Large language model (![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)) inference often suffers from high ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080) latency and limited scalability across heterogeneous edge-cloud environments. Existing speculative ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080) (SD) techniques accelerate token generation but remain confined to single-node execution. We propose DSD, a distributed speculative ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080) framework that extends SD to multi-device deployments through coordinated draft-target execution. Given the lack of prior work on simulating this paradigm, we first introduce DSD-Sim, a discrete-event simulator that captures network, batching, and scheduling dynamics. Building on insights from DSD-Sim, we further design an Adaptive Window Control (AWC) policy that dynamically adjusts speculation window size to optimize throughput. Experiments across diverse workloads show that DSD achieves up to 1.1x speedup and 9.7% higher throughput over existing SD baselines, enabling agile and scalable ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00) ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00) across edge and cloud.


## Aligning LLMs Toward Multi-Turn Conversational Outcomes Using Iterative PPO

Optimizing large language models (![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s) for multi-turn conversational outcomes remains a significant challenge, especially in goal-oriented settings like AI marketing or sales agents who facilitate transactions via messaging platforms. The difficulty stems from ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080), long-horizon rewards and the discrepancy between response-level planning and token-level generation. In this technical note, we propose a formal reduction of the multi-turn RL problem into a sequence of single-turn RLHF-style problems. This is achieved by setting a learned multi-turn Q-function as the reward model for the single-turn problem. We demonstrate and prove a key insight: solving this single-turn RL problem with standard token-level PPO is equivalent to a policy improvement step within the multi-turn problem. This insight naturally leads to Iterative PPO, a batch online policy iteration algorithm that alternates between fitting Q-functions from logged conversation trajectories and improving the policy. A major practical advantage is that Iterative PPO directly leverages stable, off-the-shelf single-turn RLHF tools, making it straightforward to implement. Our method occupies a middle ground between fully online and fully offline approaches, retaining the adaptability of online updates while gaining the stability benefits of offline training.

In this work, we investigate relativistic tidal forces around a black hole sourced by a cloud of strings, described by the generalized Letelier-Alencar solution. We first review the original Letelier spacetime and its recent generalization, computing the Kretschmann scalar, and showing that the generalized model exhibits a stronger curvature divergence at $r \to 0$ than both Letelier and Schwarzschild cases. We then analyze geodesic motion in this background. For massless particles, we focus on circular photon orbits, while for massive particles, we consider both radial infall and circular motion. We find that the radii of the photon sphere and of the innermost stable circular orbit increase with the cloud of strings parameter $g_s$ and decrease with the length scale $l_s$, and that circular orbits cease to exist in certain regions of the parameter space. For radial motion, we compute the radial ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/acceleration-F08080) and the corresponding tidal forces. In this case, we show that an inversion between stretching and ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00) may occur, although this regime is typically hidden inside the event horizon. Finally, we study tidal forces for observers in circular motion, showing that the cloud of strings modifies the Keplerian frequency and the tidal force profile even at large distances, and that in this case there is no sign change of the tidal components.

Transformer-based models have become state-of-the-art tools in various machine learning tasks, including time series classification, yet their complexity makes understanding their internal decision-making challenging. Existing explainability methods often focus on input-output attributions, leaving the internal mechanisms largely opaque. This paper addresses this gap by adapting various Mechanistic Interpretability techniques; activation patching, attention saliency, and ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080) autoencoders, from NLP to ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00) architectures designed explicitly for time series classification. We systematically probe the internal causal roles of individual attention heads and timesteps, revealing causal structures within these models. Through experimentation on a benchmark time series dataset, we construct causal graphs illustrating how information propagates internally, highlighting key attention heads and temporal positions driving correct classifications. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080) autoencoders for uncovering interpretable latent features. Our findings provide both methodological contributions to ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00) interpretability and novel insights into the functional mechanics underlying ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00) performance in time series classification tasks.

3D reassembly is a fundamental geometric problem, and in recent years it has increasingly been challenged by deep learning methods rather than classical optimization. While learning approaches have shown promising results, most still rely primarily on geometric features to assemble a whole from its parts. As a result, methods struggle when geometry alone is insufficient or ambiguous, for example, for small, eroded, or symmetric fragments. Additionally, solutions do not impose physical constraints that explicitly prevent ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080)ping assemblies. To address these limitations, we introduce E-M3RF, an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that takes as input the point clouds, containing both point positions and colors of fractured fragments, and predicts the transformations required to reassemble them using SE(3) flow matching. Each fragment is represented by both geometric and color features: i) 3D point positions are encoded as rotationconsistent geometric features using a rotation-equivariant encoder, ii) the colors at each 3D point are encoded with a ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00). The two feature sets are then combined to form a multimodal representation. We experimented on four datasets: two synthetic datasets, Breaking Bad and Fantastic Breaks, and two real-world cultural heritage datasets, RePAIR and Presious, demonstrating that E-M3RF on the RePAIR dataset reduces rotation error by 23.1% and translation error by 13.2%, while Chamfer Distance decreases by 18.4% compared to competing methods.


## Prune4Web DOM Tree Pruning Programming for Web Agent

Web automation employs intelligent agents to execute high-level tasks by mimicking human interactions with web interfaces. Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00))-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00) reading to efficient programmatic ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080). Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00) generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.

Handling contaminated data poses a critical challenge in anomaly detection, as traditional models assume training on purely normal data. Conventional methods mitigate contamination by relying on fixed contamination ratios, but discrepancies between assumed and actual ratios can severely degrade performance, especially in noisy environments where normal and abnormal data distributions ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080). To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR), a novel method that dynamically excludes anomalies using a modified z-score and Gaussian mixture model-based thresholds. AAR effectively balances the trade-off between pre![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00) normal data and excluding anomalies by integrating hard and soft rejection strategies. Extensive experiments on two image datasets and thirty tabular datasets demonstrate that AAR outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.041 AUROC. By providing a scalable and reliable solution, AAR enhances robustness against contaminated datasets, paving the way for broader real-world applications in domains such as security and healthcare.

Generative models have recently shown great promise for accelerating the design and discovery of new functional materials. Conditional generation enhances this capacity by allowing inverse design, where specific desired properties can be requested during the generation process. However, conditioning of ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00)-based approaches, in particular, is constrained by discrete tokenisation schemes and the risk of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. This work introduces Crysta![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)-π (property injection), a conditional autoregressive framework that integrates continuous property representations directly into the ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00)'s attention mechanism. Two architectures, Property-Key-Value (P![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/KV-F08080)) Prefix attention and P![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/KV-F08080) Residual attention, are presented. These methods bypass inefficient sequence-level tokenisation and preserve foundational knowledge from unsupervised pre-training on Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs) as textual input. We establish the efficacy of these mechanisms through systematic robustness studies and evaluate the framework's versatility across two distinct tasks. First, for structure recovery, the model processes high-dimensional, heterogeneous X-ray diffraction patterns, achieving structural accuracy competitive with specialised models and demonstrating applications to experimental structure recovery and polymorph differentiation. Second, for materials discovery, the model is fine-tuned on a specialised photovoltaic dataset to generate novel, stable candidates validated by Density Functional Theory (DFT). It implicitly learns to target optimal band gap regions for high photovoltaic efficiency, demonstrating a capability to map complex structure-property relationships. Crysta![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)-π provides a unified, flexible, and computationally efficient framework for inverse materials design.


## Multi-Reward GRPO for Stable and Prosodic Single-Codebook TTS LLMs at Scale

Recent advances in Large Language Models (![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s) have transformed text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, inspiring autoregressive frameworks that represent speech as sequences of discrete codec tokens. Among them, single-codebook TTS ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s have emerged as compact and streamable architectures that jointly model semantic and acoustic integration. However, despite their efficiency, these models often exhibit unstable prosody, speaker drift, and degraded naturalness. To address these issues, we propose a multi-reward Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework that directly optimizes the token generation policy of single-codebook TTS ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s. Beyond standard intelligibility and speaker similarity objectives, our design integrates three rule-based rewards: a length penalty for duration consistency, an entropy regularization reward for ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080) stability, and an ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)-annotated prosody alignment reward that explicitly supervises rhythm. In this prosody reward, an external reasoning ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00) predicts multiple plausible pause structures via in-context learning, providing a human-preference-aligned supervisory signal for GRPO training. To assess universality, we further attach a flow-matching (FM) ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080)r on top of the GRPO-optimized AR backbone and observe consistent additional gains, indicating that our reinforcement optimization enhances the intrinsic AR policy. We further conduct a scalability analysis across data sizes and model scales, revealing that the proposed method consistently enhances prosodic stability, speaker similarity, and overall speech naturalness in single-codebook TTS ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s.

Recent advances in 3D vision-language models (VLMs) highlight a strong potential for 3D scene understanding and reasoning. However, effectively tokenizing 3D scenes into holistic scene tokens, and leveraging these tokens across diverse 3D understanding tasks, remain highly challenging. We present NDTokenizer3D, a generalist 3D VLM that performs a wide range of 3D scene understanding tasks while naturally supporting human interactions, thereby bridging language-level reasoning with 3D spatial understanding. The core of our approach is a novel three-stage scene tokenization pipeline built upon a Multi-Scale Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) representation, paired with a Multi-Scale NDT Decoder (MSDec). Specifically, NDTokenizer3D first constructs a multi-scale NDT representation from raw high-resolution point clouds, pre![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00) both global context and fine-grained geometric details. Next, the MSDec progressively fuses cross-scale NDT features, producing holistic scene tokens consumable by ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00) endpoints. Beyond tokenization, MSDec is repurposed as a general interface for human-interactive prompting (points, boxes, masks) and segmentation-mask ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080), unifying diverse 3D scene understanding tasks within a single architecture. With this compact and unified design, NDTokenizer3D offers a fine-grained, general-purpose 3D VLM, achieving remarkable improvements in 3D Referring Segmentation, 3D Visual Question Answering, and 3D Dense Captioning.

Large-scale vision generative models, including diffusion and flow models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, transferring these pre-trained models to downstream tasks often results in significant parameter redundancy. In this paper, we propose EntPruner, an entropy-guided automatic progressive ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080) framework for diffusion and flow models. First, we introduce entropy-guided ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080), a block-level importance assessment strategy specifically designed for generative models. Unlike discriminative models, generative models require pre![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00) the diversity and condition-fidelity of the output distribution. As the importance of each module can vary significantly across downstream tasks, EntPruner prioritizes ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080) of less important blocks using data-dependent Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) as a guiding metric. CED quantifies how much the distribution diverges from the learned conditional data distribution after removing a block. Second, we propose a zero-shot adaptive ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080) framework to automatically determine when and how much to prune during training. This dynamic strategy avoids the pitfalls of one-shot ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080), mitigating mode collapse, and pre![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00) model performance. Extensive experiments on DiT and SiT models demonstrate the effectiveness of EntPruner, achieving up to 2.22$\times$ inference speedup while maintaining competitive generation quality on ImageNet and three downstream datasets.


## MLPMoE Zero-Shot Architectural Metamorphosis of Dense LLM MLPs into Static Mixture-of-Experts

Large Language Models (![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s) are predominantly deployed as dense ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00)s, where every parameter in every feed-forward block is activated for every token. While architecturally simple, this is computationally inefficient, since inference costs scale linearly with parameter count. Recent upcycling methods such as MoEfication, CMoE, ToMoE, and MoORE reveal that much of the useful computation lives in ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080), semi-modular substructures inside dense feed-forward networks, but these approaches typically rely on clustering, activation profiling, singular value decomposition, or custom routing that requires calibration data. This paper introduces MLPMoE (MLP Mixture-of-Experts), a training-free, deterministic transformation that restructures the dense MLP in ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00) blocks into a static, high-cardinality mixture of experts. The transformation uses simple tensor slicing and summation, reinterpreting the algebra of tensor parallelism as a topological conversion rather than a distributed training pattern. We further introduce Fractal Fade (differential branch ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080)) and Compensated Pruning (variance-pre![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00) branch reduction) as lightweight mechanisms for structured ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080). On Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, the zero-shot MLPMoE transform changes a proxy perplexity metric by less than 0.05 percent while keeping the parameter count effectively constant. On the 8B model, differential ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080) removes about 20 percent of MLP parameters while keeping perplexity within about 2 percent of the dense baseline. The method operates entirely post hoc on existing checkpoints and does not require gradients, calibration sets, or router training.

Effective post-training is essential to align Large Language Models (![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s) with specialized biomedical knowledge to accelerate life science research. However, current approaches face significant limitations. First, biomedical reasoning involves intricate mechanisms often represented by ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080) textual data. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit to surface-level instruction patterns without effectively internalizing this fragmented scientific knowledge. Second, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is impractical for this domain, as defining meaningful rewards often necessitates prohibitive experimental validation (e.g., wet-lab verification of drug responses), rendering real-time feedback unfeasible. We propose Balanced Fine-Tuning (BFT), an efficient post-training method designed to learn complex reasoning from ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080) data without external reward signals. BFT operates through a two-layer weighting mechanism: 1. At the token level, it scales loss via prediction probabilities to stabilize gradients and prevent overfitting; 2. At the sample level, it uses "minimum group confidence" to adaptively enhance the learning of hard samples. Experiments demonstrate that BFT significantly outperforms SFT. In medical tasks, it enables ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s to acquire knowledge that SFT misses. In biological tasks, BFT-based ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s surpass GeneAgent (an accurate agent for biology analysis) in biological process reasoning. Moreover, the text embeddings generated by BFT can be directly applied to downstream tasks, such as gene interaction and single-cell perturbation response prediction.

Holography offers significant potential for AR/VR applications, yet its adoption is limited by the high demands of data ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00). Existing deep learning approaches generally lack rate adaptivity within a single network. We present RAVQ-HoloNet, a rate-adaptive vector ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080) framework that achieves high-fidelity reconstructions at low and ultra-low bit rates, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods. In low bit, our method exceeds by -33.91% in BD-Rate and achieves a BD-PSNR of 1.02 dB from the best existing method demonstrated by the rate-distortion curve.

Collaborative machine learning across healthcare institutions promises improved diagnostic accuracy by leveraging diverse datasets, yet privacy regulations such as HIPAA prohibit direct patient data sharing. While federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training without raw data exchange, recent studies show that model gradients in conventional FL remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, potentially exposing sensitive medical information. This paper presents a privacy-pre![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00) federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080) reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction. In contrast, the proposed CLS-protected HE approach prevents such attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, requiring only 326 KB of encrypted data transmission per aggregation round. The framework achieves 96.12 percent global classification accuracy in the unencrypted domain and 90.02 percent in the encrypted domain.

To meet strict Service-Level Objectives (SLOs),contemporary Large Language Models (![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s) decouple the ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/prefill-F08080) and ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080) stages and place them on separate GPUs to mitigate the distinct bottlenecks inherent to each phase. However, the heterogeneity of ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00) workloads causes producerconsumer imbalance between the two instance types in such ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/disaggregate-F08080)d architecture. To address this problem, we propose DOPD (Dynamic Optimal Prefill/Decoding), a dynamic ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00) inference system that adjusts instance allocations to achieve an optimal ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/prefill-F08080)-to-![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080) (P/D) ratio based on real-time load monitoring. Combined with an appropriate request-scheduling policy, DOPD effectively resolves imbalances between ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/prefill-F08080) and ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080) instances and mitigates resource allocation mismatches due to mixed-length requests under high concurrency. Experimental evaluations show that, compared with v![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00) and DistServe (representative aggregation-based and disaggregationbased approaches), DOPD improves overall system goodput by up to 1.5X, decreases P90 time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 67.5%, and decreases P90 time-per-output-token (TPOT) by up to 22.8%. Furthermore, our dynamic P/D adjustment technique performs proactive reconfiguration based on historical load, achieving over 99% SLOs attainment while using less additional resources.

Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) demonstrate impressive performance across diverse tasks, ranging from speech recognition to general audio understanding. However, their scalability is limited by the quadratic complexity of attention and the high token rates of audio signals. These challenges make it difficult to extend LALMs to long-form audio and to deploy them on resource-constrained platforms such as edge devices.
  In this paper, we explore techniques such as unsupervised segmentation, uniform average pooling, etc., to reduce the number of audio tokens generated by the LALM's audio encoder but before they are consumed by the ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00) ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080)r. To mitigate potential performance degradation introduced by the compressed representations, we employ low-rank adapters to finetune the model. We evaluate our proposed models on two tasks, automatic speech recognition and speech-to-speech translation tasks, that are dependent on effectively uncovering the underlying lexical content of the input signal and study the effect of downsampling on these tasks. Experimental results show that compressed LALMs can achieve performance closer to frame-level LALMs while reducing the input audio token count upto three times before the ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00) backbone.

Traffic cameras are essential in urban areas, playing a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080)ping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time. Additionally, TrafficLens intelligently bypasses redundant VLM invocations through an object-level similarity detector. Experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate that TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to $4\times$ while maintaining information accuracy.

Despite displaying semantic competence, large language models' internal mechanisms that ground abstract semantic structure remain insufficiently characterised. We propose a method integrating role-cross minimal pairs, temporal emergence analysis, and cross-model comparison to study how ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s implement semantic roles. Our analysis uncovers: (i) highly concentrated circuits (89-94% attribution within 28 nodes); (ii) gradual structural refinement rather than phase transitions, with larger models sometimes bypassing localised circuits; and (iii) moderate cross-scale conservation (24-59% component ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080)) alongside high spectral similarity. These findings suggest that ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s form compact, causally isolated mechanisms for abstract semantic structure, and these mechanisms exhibit partial transfer across scales and architectures.

Multi-agent systems (MAS) extend large language models (![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s) from independent single-model reasoning to coordinative system-level intelligence. While existing ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00) agents depend on text-based mediation for reasoning and ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080), we take a step forward by enabling models to collaborate directly within the continuous latent space. We introduce LatentMAS, an end-to-end training-free framework that enables pure latent collaboration among ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00) agents. In LatentMAS, each agent first performs auto-regressive latent thoughts generation through last-layer hidden embeddings. A shared latent working memory then preserves and transfers each agent's internal representations, ensuring lossless information exchange. We provide theoretical analyses establishing that LatentMAS attains higher expressiveness and lossless information preservation with substantially lower complexity than vanilla text-based MAS. In addition, empirical evaluations across 9 comprehensive benchmarks spanning math and science reasoning, commonsense understanding, and code generation show that LatentMAS consistently outperforms strong single-model and text-based MAS baselines, achieving up to 14.6% higher accuracy, reducing output token usage by 70.8%-83.7%, and providing 4x-4.3x faster end-to-end inference. These results demonstrate that our new latent collaboration framework enhances system-level reasoning quality while offering substantial efficiency gains without any additional training.

We propose a novel quantum-resistant mutual authentication scheme for radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems. Our scheme uses lattice-based cryptography and, in particular, achieves quantum-resistance by leveraging the hardness of the inhomogeneous short integer solution (ISIS) problem. In contrast to prior work, which assumes that the reader-server ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080) channel is secure, our scheme is secure even when both the reader-server and tag-reader ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080) channels are insecure. Our proposed protocol provides robust security against man-in-the-middle (MITM), replay, impersonation, and reflection attacks, while also ensuring unforgeability and pre![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00) anonymity. We present a detailed security analysis, including semi-formal analysis and formal verification using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. In addition, we analyze the storage, computation, and ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080) costs of the proposed protocol and compare its security properties with those of existing protocols, demonstrating that our scheme offers strong security guarantees. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first quantum-resistant authentication protocol for RFID systems that comprehensively addresses the insecurity of both the reader-server and tag-reader ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080) channels.

As demand for ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00) inference grows, it is becoming increasingly important that providers and their customers can verify that inference processes are performed correctly, without errors or tampering. However, re-running the same inference process twice often leads to different results due to benign numerical noise, making it difficult to distinguish legitimate variation from actual problems. To address this problem, we introduce Token-DiFR (Token-Divergence-From-Reference), a method for verifying inference outputs by comparing generated tokens against predictions made by a trusted reference implementation conditioned on the same random seed. Sampling seed synchronization tightly constrains valid outputs, leaving providers minimal room to deviate from correct inference, which allows output tokens themselves to serve as auditable evidence of correctness at zero additional cost to the provider. Token-DiFR reliably identifies sampling errors, simulated bugs, and model ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080), detecting 4-bit ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080) with AUC $>$ 0.999 within 300 output tokens. For applications requiring sample-efficient forward-pass verification, we additionally introduce Activation-DiFR, a scheme that uses random orthogonal projections to compress activations into compact fingerprints for subsequent verification. Activation-DiFR detects 4-bit ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080) with AUC $>$ 0.999 using just 2 output tokens, while reducing ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080) overhead by 25-75% relative to existing methods. We release an open-source integration with v![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00) to accelerate practical deployment of verifiable inference.

Adaptive optimizers are the de facto standard in non-private training as they often enable faster convergence and improved performance. In contrast, differentially private (DP) training is still predominantly performed with DP-SGD, typically requiring extensive compute and hyperparameter tuning. We propose DP-MicroAdam, a memory-efficient and ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080)-aware adaptive DP optimizer. We prove that DP-MicroAdam converges in stochastic non-convex optimization at the optimal $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate, up to privacy-dependent constants. Empirically, DP-MicroAdam outperforms existing adaptive DP optimizers and achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared to DP-SGD across a range of benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, large-scale ImageNet training, and private fine-tuning of pretrained ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00)s. These results demonstrate that adaptive optimization can improve both performance and stability under differential privacy.

In Vision Language Models (VLMs), vision tokens are quantity-heavy yet information-dispersed compared with language tokens, thus consume too much unnecessary computation. Pruning redundant vision tokens for high VLM inference efficiency has been continuously studied but all existing methods resort to indirect and non-guaranteed ways. We propose OC-VTP, a direct and guaranteed approach to select the most representative vision tokens for high-efficiency yet accuracy-pre![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00) VLM inference. Our OC-VTP requires merely light-weight pre-training of a small object-centric vision token pruner, which can then be inserted into existing VLMs, without fine-tuning of any models on any datasets. It is gauranteed that the most representative vision tokens are kept by minimizing the error in reconstructing the original unpruned tokens from the selected ones. Across any vision ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080) ratios, i.e., inference efficiency, our OC-VTP consistently helps mainstream VLMs to preserve the highest inference accuracy. Our ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080) also demonstrates interesting interpretability. Our codes are available at https://github.com/GarryLarry010131/OC-VTP.

With this work, we describe the concept of intent-based query rewriting and present a first viable solution. The aim is to allow rewrites to alter the structure and syntactic outcome of an original query while keeping the obtainable insights intact. This drastically differs from traditional query rewriting, which typically aims to decrease query evaluation time by using strict equivalence rules and optimization heuristics on the query plan. Rewriting queries to queries that only provide a similar insight but otherwise can be entirely different can remedy inaccessible original data tables due to access control, privacy, or expensive data access regarding monetary cost or remote access. In this paper, we put forward INQURE, a system designed for INtent-based QUery REwriting. It uses access to a large language model (![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)) for the query understanding and human-like derivation of alternate queries. Around the ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00), INQURE employs upfront table filtering and subsequent candidate rewrite ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080) and ranking. We report on the results of an evaluation using a benchmark set of over 900 database table schemas and discuss the pros and cons of alternate approaches regarding runtime and quality of the rewrites of a user study.

Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art generation quality but require long sequential denoising trajectories, leading to high inference latency. Recent speculative inference methods enable lossless parallel sampling in U-Net-based diffusion models via a drafter-verifier scheme, but their ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/acceleration-F08080) is limited on DiTs due to insufficient draft accuracy during verification. To address this limitation, we analyze the DiTs' feature dynamics and find the features of the final ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00) layer (top-block) exhibit strong temporal consistency and rich semantic abstraction. Based on this insight, we propose FREE, a novel framework that employs a lightweight drafter to perform feature-level autoregression with parallel verification, guaranteeing lossless ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/acceleration-F08080) with theoretical and empirical support. Meanwhile, prediction variance (uncertainty) of DiTs naturally increases in later denoising steps, reducing acceptance rates under speculative sampling. To mitigate this effect, we further introduce an uncertainty-guided relaxation strategy, forming FREE (relax), which dynamically adjusts the acceptance probability in response to uncertainty levels. Experiments on ImageNet-$512^2$ show that FREE achieves up to $1.86 \times$ ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/acceleration-F08080), and FREE (relax) further reaches $2.25 \times$ speedup while maintaining high perceptual and quantitative fidelity in generation quality.

Speculative ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080) accelerates ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00) inference by utilizing otherwise idle computational resources during memory-to-chip data transfer. Current speculative ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080) methods typically assume a considerable amount of available computing power, then generate a complex and massive draft tree using a small autoregressive language model to improve overall prediction accuracy. However, methods like batching have been widely applied in mainstream model inference systems as a superior alternative to speculative ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080), as they compress the available idle computing power. Therefore, performing speculative ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080) with low verification resources and low scheduling costs has become an important research problem. We believe that more capable models that allow for parallel generation on draft sequences are what we truly need. Recognizing the fundamental nature of draft models to only generate sequences of limited length, we propose SpecFormer, a novel architecture that integrates unidirectional and bidirectional attention mechanisms. SpecFormer combines the autoregressive model's ability to extract information from the entire input sequence with the parallel generation benefits of non-autoregressive models. This design eliminates the reliance on large prefix trees and achieves consistent ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/acceleration-F08080), even in large-batch scenarios. Through lossless speculative ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080) experiments across models of various scales, we demonstrate that SpecFormer sets a new standard for scaling ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00) inference with lower training demands and reduced computational costs.

Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD) faces significant challenges due to low signal-to-noise ratios, complex backgrounds, and the absence of discernible target features. While deep learning-based encoder-![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080)r frameworks have advanced the field, their static pattern learning suffers from pattern drift across diverse scenarios (\emph{e.g.}, day/night variations, sky/maritime/ground domains), limiting robustness.

Our approach establishes a dynamic mapping between infrared image features and entire ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080)r parameters via an image-to-![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080)r ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00).

To further enhance the perception ability of infrared images, we integrate high-frequency components to supplement target-position and scene-edge information. Experiments on NUDT-SIRST, NUAA-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K datasets demonstrate the superiority of our IrisNet, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Transformer-based language models exhibit complex and distributed behavior, yet their internal computations remain poorly understood. Existing mechanistic interpretability methods typically treat attention heads and multilayer perceptron layers (MLPs) (the building blocks of a ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00) architecture) as indivisible units, overlooking possibilities of functional substructure learned within them. In this work, we introduce a more fine-grained perspective that decomposes these components into orthogonal singular directions, revealing superposed and independent computations within a single head or MLP. We validate our perspective on widely used standard tasks like Indirect Object Identification (IOI), Gender Pronoun (GP), and Greater Than (GT), showing that previously identified canonical functional heads, such as the name mover, encode multiple ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080)ping subfunctions aligned with distinct singular directions. Nodes in a computational graph, that are previously identified as circuit elements show strong activation along specific low-rank directions, suggesting that meaningful computations reside in compact subspaces. While some directions remain challenging to interpret fully, our results highlight that ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00) computations are more distributed, structured, and compositional than previously assumed. This perspective opens new avenues for fine-grained mechanistic interpretability and a deeper understanding of model internals.

We focus on designing a novel, ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080)-efficient algorithm that still yields accurate trained models. To this end, we employ several mechanisms to reduce the number of ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080)s with the ground station (local training) and their size (![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00)).

We analyze the convergence of the resulting algorithm, and compare it with the state of the art through simulations in a realistic space scenario, showcasing superior performance.

This report presents the solution and results of our team MSRA\_SC in the Commonsense Persona-Grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC 2025). We propose a simple yet effective framework that unifies improvements across both GPU Track and API Track. Our method centers on two key components. First, Context Engineering applies dynamic tool ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080) and persona clipping for input ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00), combined with post-processing techniques such as parameter normalization and function merging. Together with manually refined prompts, this design improves tool call stability, execution reliability, and role-playing guidance. Second, in the GPU Track, we further adopt GRPO training, replacing supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning directly optimized by reward signals. This mitigates small-sample overfitting and significantly enhances task-oriented dialogue performance. In the final evaluation, our team ranks 1st in Task 2 API, 2nd in Task 1 API, and 3rd in both Task 3 API and GPU track, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

The rapid increase in ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00) model sizes and the growing demand for long-context inference have made memory a critical bottleneck in GPU-accelerated ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00) systems. Although high-bandwidth memory (HBM) on GPUs offers fast access, its limited capacity necessitates reliance on host memory (CPU DRAM) to support larger working sets such as the ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/KV-F08080)Cache. However, the maximum DRAM capacity is constrained by the limited number of memory channels per CPU socket. To overcome this limitation, current systems often adopt RDMA-based ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/disaggregate-F08080)d memory pools, which introduce significant challenges including high access latency, complex ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080) protocols, and synchronization overhead. Fortunately, the emerging CXL technology introduces new opportunities in ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/KV-F08080)Cache design. In this paper, we propose Beluga, a novel memory architecture that enables GPUs and CPUs to access a shared, large-scale memory pool through CXL switches. By supporting native load/store access semantics over the CXL fabric, our design delivers near-local memory latency, while reducing programming complexity and minimizing synchronization overhead. We conduct a systematic characterization of a commercial CXL switch-based memory pool and propose a set of design guidelines. Based on Beluga, we design and implement Beluga-![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/KV-F08080)Cache, a system tailored for managing the large-scale ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/KV-F08080)Cache in ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00) inference. Beluga-![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/KV-F08080)Cache achieves an 89.6% reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and 7.35x throughput improvement in the v![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00) inference engine compared to RDMA-based solutions. To the best of our knowledge, Beluga is the first system that enables GPUs to directly access large-scale memory pools through CXL switches, marking a significant step toward low-latency, shared access to vast memory resources by GPUs.

Parametric 3D human models such as SMPL have driven significant advances in human pose and shape estimation, yet their simplified kinematics limit biomechanical realism. The recently proposed SKEL model addresses this limitation by re-rigging SMPL with an anatomically accurate skeleton. However, estimating SKEL parameters directly remains challenging due to limited training data, perspective ambiguities, and the inherent complexity of human articulation. We introduce SKEL-CF, a coarse-to-fine framework for SKEL parameter estimation. SKEL-CF employs a ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00)-based encoder-![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080)r architecture, where the encoder predicts coarse camera and SKEL parameters, and the ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080)r progressively refines them in successive layers. To ensure anatomically consistent supervision, we convert the existing SMPL-based dataset 4DHuman into a SKEL-aligned version, 4DHuman-SKEL, providing high-quality training data for SKEL estimation. In addition, to mitigate depth and scale ambiguities, we explicitly incorporate camera modeling into the SKEL-CF pipeline and demonstrate its importance across diverse viewpoints. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed design. On the challenging MOYO dataset, SKEL-CF achieves 85.0 MPJPE / 51.4 PA-MPJPE, significantly outperforming the previous SKEL-based state-of-the-art HSMR (104.5 / 79.6). These results establish SKEL-CF as a scalable and anatomically faithful framework for human motion analysis, bridging the gap between computer vision and biomechanics. Our implementation is available on the project page: https://pokerman8.github.io/SKEL-CF/.

This paper presents a novel approach to neural network ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00) that addresses redundancy at both the filter and architectural levels through a unified framework grounded in information flow analysis. Building on the concept of tensor flow divergence, which quantifies how information is transformed across network layers, we develop a two-stage optimization process. The first stage employs iterative divergence-aware ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080) to identify and remove redundant filters while pre![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00) critical information pathways. The second stage extends this principle to higher-level architecture optimization by analyzing layer-wise contributions to information propagation and selectively eliminating entire layers that demonstrate minimal impact on network performance. The proposed method naturally adapts to diverse architectures, including convolutional networks, ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00)s, and hybrid designs, providing a consistent metric for comparing the structural importance across different layer types. Experimental validation across multiple modern architectures and datasets reveals that this combined approach achieves substantial model ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00) while maintaining competitive accuracy. The presented approach achieves parameter reduction results that are globally comparable to those of state-of-the-art solutions and outperforms them across a wide range of modern neural network architectures, from convolutional models to ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00)s. The results demonstrate how flow divergence serves as an effective guiding principle for both filter-level and layer-level optimization, offering practical benefits for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

The quadratic complexity of full attention limits efficient long-context processing in large language models (![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s). Sparse attention mitigates this cost by restricting each query to attend to a subset of previous tokens; however, training-free approaches often lead to severe performance degradation. Native ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080)-attention methods (e.g., NSA, MoBA) alleviate this issue, yet exhibit a critical paradox: they produce lower attention ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080) than full-attention models, despite aiming to approximate full attention, which may constrain their effectiveness. We attribute this paradox to gradient update deficiency: low-ranked key-value pairs excluded during ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080) training receive neither forward contribution nor backward gradients, and thus never learn proper suppression. To overcome this limitation, we propose SSA (Sparse Sparse Attention), a unified training framework that considers both ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080) and full attention and enforces bidirectional alignment at every layer. This design preserves gradient flow to all tokens while explicitly encouraging ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080)-attention outputs to align with their full-attention counterparts, thereby promoting stronger ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080). As a result, SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance under both ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080) and full attention inference across multiple commonsense benchmarks. Furthermore, SSA enables models to adapt smoothly to varying ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080) budgets; performance improves consistently as more tokens are allowed to attend, supporting flexible compute-performance trade-offs at inference time. Finally, we show that native ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080)-attention training surprisingly improves long-context extrapolation by mitigating the over-allocation of attention values in sink areas, with SSA demonstrating the strongest extrapolation capability.

Personalized Large Language Models (P![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s) aim to align model outputs with individual user preferences, a crucial capability for user-centric applications. However, the prevalent approach of fine-tuning a separate module for each user faces two major limitations: (1) storage costs scale linearly with the number of users, rendering the method unscalable; and (2) fine-tuning a static model from scratch often yields suboptimal performance for users with ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080) data. To address these challenges, we propose MTA, a Merge-then-Adapt framework for P![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s. MTA comprises three key stages. First, we construct a shared Meta-LoRA Bank by selecting anchor users and pre-training meta-personalization traits within meta-LoRA modules. Second, to ensure scalability and enable dynamic personalization combination beyond static models, we introduce an Adaptive LoRA Fusion stage. This stage retrieves and dynamically merges the most relevant anchor meta-LoRAs to synthesize a user-specific one, thereby eliminating the need for user-specific storage and supporting more flexible personalization. Third, we propose a LoRA Stacking for Few-Shot Personalization stage, which applies an additional ultra-low-rank, lightweight LoRA module on top of the merged LoRA. Fine-tuning this module enables effective personalization under few-shot settings. Extensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing SOTA methods across multiple tasks.

Point cloud ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00) methods jointly optimize bitrates and reconstruction distortion. However, balancing ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00) ratio and reconstruction quality is difficult because low-frequency and high-frequency components contribute differently at the same resolution. To address this, we propose FLaTEC, a frequency-aware ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00) model that enables the ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00) of a full scan with high ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00) ratios. Our approach introduces a frequency-aware mechanism that decouples low-frequency structures and high-frequency textures, while hybridizing latent triplanes as a compact proxy for point cloud. Specifically, we convert voxelized embeddings into triplane representations to reduce ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080), computational cost, and storage requirements. We then devise a frequency-disentangling technique that extracts compact low-frequency content while collecting high-frequency details across scales. The decoupled low-frequency and high-frequency components are stored in binary format. During ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080), full-spectrum signals are progressively recovered via a modulation block. Additionally, to compensate for the loss of 3D correlation, we introduce an efficient frequency-based attention mechanism that fosters local connectivity and outputs arbitrary resolution points. Our method achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance and outperforms the standard codecs by 78\% and 94\% in BD-rate on both SemanticKITTI and Ford datasets.

Cross-Disciplinary Cold-start Knowledge Tracing (CDCKT) faces a critical challenge: insufficient student interaction data in the target discipline prevents effective knowledge state modeling and performance prediction. Existing cross-disciplinary methods rely on ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080)ping entities between disciplines for knowledge transfer through simple mapping functions, but suffer from two key limitations: (1) ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080)ping entities are scarce in real-world scenarios, and (2) simple mappings inadequately capture cross-disciplinary knowledge complexity. To overcome these challenges, we propose Mixed of Experts and Adversarial Generative Network-based Cross-disciplinary Cold-start Knowledge Tracing Framework. Our approach consists of three key components: First, we pre-train a source discipline model and cluster student knowledge states into K categories. Second, these cluster attributes guide a mixture-of-experts network through a gating mechanism, ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00) as a cross-domain mapping bridge. Third, an adversarial discriminator enforces feature separation by pulling same-attribute student features closer while pushing different-attribute features apart, effectively mitigating small-sample limitations. We validate our method's effectiveness across 20 extreme cross-disciplinary cold-start scenarios.

Vision-Language Action (VLA) models unify perception, reasoning, and trajectory generation for autonomous driving, but suffer from significant inference latency due to deep ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00) stacks. We present DeeAD, a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that accelerates VLA planning by evaluating the physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories. Instead of relying on confidence scores, DeeAD terminates inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors (e.g., Navigation or Low-precision Planning) within a tolerable deviation (<2m). To improve efficiency, we introduce a multi-hop controller that adaptively skips redundant layers based on the change rate of scores. DeeAD integrates into existing VLA models, such as ORION, without requiring retraining. Experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate up to 28% ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00)-layer ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080) and 29% latency reduction, while pre![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00) planning quality and safety.

Recent advancements in multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation (mRAG), which enhance multi-modal large language models (M![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s) with external knowledge, have demonstrated that the collective intelligence of multiple agents can significantly outperform a single model through effective ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080). Despite impressive performance, existing multi-agent systems inherently incur substantial token overhead and increased computational costs, posing challenges for large-scale deployment. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-agent hierarchical ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080) graph PRUNING framework, termed M$^3$Prune. Our framework eliminates redundant edges across different modalities, achieving an optimal balance between task performance and token overhead. Specifically, M$^3$Prune first applies intra-modal graph sparsification to textual and visual modalities, identifying the edges most critical for solving the task. Subsequently, we construct a dynamic ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080) topology using these key edges for inter-modal graph sparsification. Finally, we progressively prune redundant edges to obtain a more efficient and hierarchical topology. Extensive experiments on both general and domain-specific mRAG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both single-agent and robust multi-agent mRAG systems while significantly reducing token consumption.

Federated learning (FL) has been extensively studied as a privacy-pre![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00) training paradigm. Recently, federated block coordinate descent scheme has become a popular option in training large-scale models, as it allows clients to train only a subset of the model locally instead of the entire model. However, in the era of large language models (![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s), even a single block can contain a significant number of parameters, posing substantial ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080) latency, particularly for resource-constrained clients. To address this challenge in federated training/fine-tuning ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s, we propose ParaBlock, a novel approach that establishes two parallel threads for ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080) and computation to enhance ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080) efficiency. We theoretically prove that the proposed ParaBlock achieves the same convergence rate as the standard federated block coordinate descent methods. Empirical evaluations on fine-tuning ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s on general instruction following and mathematical reasoning confirm that ParaBlock not only maintains strong performance but also significantly improves ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080) efficiency.

Channel coding from 2G to 5G has assumed the inputs bits at the physical layer to be uniformly distributed. However, hybrid automatic repeat request acknowledgement (HARQ-ACK) bits transmitted in the uplink are inherently non-uniformly distributed. For such sources, significant performance gains could be obtained by employing joint source channel coding, aided by deep learning-based techniques. In this paper, we learn a ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00)-based encoder using a novel "free-lunch" training algorithm and propose per-codeword power shaping to exploit the source prior at the encoder whilst being robust to small changes in the HARQ-ACK distribution. Furthermore, any HARQ-ACK ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080)r has to achieve a low negative acknowledgement (NACK) error rate to avoid radio link failures resulting from multiple NACK errors. We develop an extension of the Neyman-Pearson test to a coded bit system with multiple information bits to achieve Unequal Error Protection of NACK over ACK bits at the ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080)r. Finally, we apply the proposed encoder and ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080)r designs to a 5G New Radio (NR) compliant uplink setup under a fading channel, describing the optimal receiver design and a low complexity coherent approximation to it. Our results demonstrate 3-6 dB reduction in the average transmit power required to achieve the target error rates compared to the NR baseline, while also achieving a 2-3 dB reduction in the maximum transmit power, thus providing for significant coverage gains and power savings.
