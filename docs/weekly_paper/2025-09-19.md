## LNE-Blocking An Efficient Framework for Contamination Mitigation Evaluation on Large Language Models

The problem of data contamination is now almost inevitable during the
development of large language models (![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s), with the training data commonly
integrating those evaluation benchmarks even unintentionally. This problem
subsequently makes it hard to benchmark ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s fairly. Instead of constructing
contamination-free datasets (quite hard), we propose a novel framework,
\textbf{LNE-Blocking}, to restore model performance prior to contamination on
potentially leaked datasets. Our framework consists of two components:
contamination detection and disruption operation. For the prompt, the framework
first uses the contamination detection method, \textbf{LNE}, to assess the
extent of contamination in the model. Based on this, it adjusts the intensity
of the disruption operation, \textbf{Blocking}, to elicit non-memorized
responses from the model. Our framework is the first to efficiently restore the
model's greedy ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080) performance. This comes with a strong performance on
multiple datasets with potential leakage risks, and it consistently achieves
stable recovery results across different models and varying levels of data
contamination. We release the code at https://github.com/RuijieH/LNE-Blocking
to facilitate research.


## Beyond Surface Alignment Rebuilding LLMs Safety Mechanism via Probabilistically Ablating Refusal Direction

Jailbreak attacks pose persistent threats to large language models (![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s).
Current safety alignment methods have attempted to address these issues, but
they experience two significant limitations: insufficient safety alignment
depth and unrobust internal defense mechanisms. These limitations make them
vulnerable to adversarial attacks such as ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/prefill-F08080)ing and refusal direction
manipulation. We introduce DeepRefusal, a robust safety alignment framework
that overcomes these issues. DeepRefusal forces the model to dynamically
rebuild its refusal mechanisms from jailbreak states. This is achieved by
probabilistically ablating the refusal direction across layers and token depths
during fine-tuning. Our method not only defends against ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/prefill-F08080)ing and refusal
direction attacks but also demonstrates strong resilience against other unseen
jailbreak strategies. Extensive evaluations on four open-source ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00) families
and six representative attacks show that DeepRefusal reduces attack success
rates by approximately 95%, while maintaining model capabilities with minimal
performance degradation.


## MaRVIn A Cross-Layer Mixed-Precision RISC-V Framework for DNN Inference, from ISA Extension to Hardware Acceleration

The evolution of ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080) and mixed-precision techniques has unlocked new
possibilities for enhancing the speed and energy efficiency of NNs. Several
recent studies indicate that adapting precision levels across different
parameters can maintain accuracy comparable to full-precision models while
significantly reducing computational demands. However, existing embedded
microprocessors lack sufficient architectural support for efficiently executing
mixed-precision NNs, both in terms of ISA extensions and hardware design,
resulting in inefficiencies such as excessive data packing/unpacking and
underutilized arithmetic units. In this work, we propose novel ISA extensions
and a micro-architecture implementation specifically designed to optimize
mixed-precision execution, enabling energy-efficient deep learning inference on
RISC-V architectures. We introduce MaRVIn, a cross-layer hardware-software
co-design framework that enhances power efficiency and performance through a
combination of hardware improvements, mixed-precision ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080), ISA-level
optimizations, and cycle-accurate emulation. At the hardware level, we enhance
the ALU with configurable mixed-precision arithmetic (2, 4, 8 bits) for
weights/activations and employ multi-pumping to reduce execution latency while
implementing soft SIMD for efficient 2-bit ops. At the software level, we
integrate a ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080)-aware fine-tuning method to optimize model ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00) and
a greedy-based DSE approach to efficiently search for Pareto-optimal
mixed-![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/quantize-F08080)d models. Additionally, we incorporate voltage scaling to boost
the power efficiency of our system. Our experimental evaluation over widely
used DNNs and datasets, such as CIFAR10 and ImageNet, demonstrates that our
framework can achieve, on average, 17.6x speedup for less than 1% accuracy loss
and outperforms the ISA-agnostic state-of-the-art RISC-V cores, delivering up
to 1.8 TOPs/W.

Large language models (![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s) benefit from test-time scaling, but existing
methods face significant challenges, including severe synchronization overhead,
memory bottlenecks, and latency, especially during speculative ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080) with
long reasoning chains. We introduce A1 (Asynchronous Test-Time Scaling), a
statistically guaranteed adaptive inference framework that addresses these
challenges. A1 refines arithmetic intensity to identify synchronization as the
dominant bottleneck, proposes an online calibration strategy to enable
asynchronous inference, and designs a three-stage rejection sampling pipeline
that supports both sequential and parallel scaling. Through experiments on the
MATH, AMC23, AIME24, and AIME25 datasets, across various draft-target model
families, we demonstrate that A1 achieves a remarkable 56.7x speedup in
test-time scaling and a 4.14x improvement in throughput, all while maintaining
accurate rejection-rate control, reducing latency and memory overhead, and no
accuracy loss compared to using target model scaling alone. These results
position A1 as an efficient and principled solution for scalable ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00) inference.
We have released the code at
https://github.com/menik1126/asynchronous-test-time-scaling.


## Adaptive LoRA Experts Allocation and Selection for Federated Fine-Tuning

Large Language Models (![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
various tasks, but fine-tuning them for domain-specific applications often
requires substantial domain-specific data that may be distributed across
multiple organizations. Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-pre![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00)
solution, but faces challenges with computational constraints when applied to
![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach, though a single LoRA module often struggles with
heterogeneous data across diverse domains. This paper addresses two critical
challenges in federated LoRA fine-tuning: 1. determining the optimal number and
allocation of LoRA experts across heterogeneous clients, and 2. enabling
clients to selectively utilize these experts based on their specific data
characteristics. We propose FedLEASE (Federated adaptive LoRA Expert Allocation
and SElection), a novel framework that adaptively clusters clients based on
representation similarity to allocate and train domain-specific LoRA experts.
It also introduces an adaptive top-$M$ Mixture-of-Experts mechanism that allows
each client to select the optimal number of utilized experts. Our extensive
experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedLEASE
significantly outperforms existing federated fine-tuning approaches in
heterogeneous client settings while maintaining ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080) efficiency.


## Communication Efficient Split Learning of ViTs with Attention-based Double Compression

This paper proposes a novel ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080)-efficient Split Learning (SL)
framework, named Attention-based Double Compression (ADC), which reduces the
![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080) overhead required for transmitting intermediate Vision
Transformers activations during the SL training process. ADC incorporates two
parallel ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00) strategies. The first one merges samples' activations that
are similar, based on the average attention score calculated in the last client
layer; this strategy is class-agnostic, meaning that it can also merge samples
having different classes, without losing generalization ability nor decreasing
final results. The second strategy follows the first and discards the least
meaningful tokens, further reducing the ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080) cost. Combining these
strategies not only allows for sending less during the forward pass, but also
the gradients are naturally compressed, allowing the whole model to be trained
without additional tuning or approximations of the gradients. Simulation
results demonstrate that Attention-based Double Compression outperforms
state-of-the-art SL frameworks by significantly reducing ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080)
overheads while maintaining high accuracy.


## Value-Guided KV Compression for LLMs via Approximated CUR Decomposition

Key-value (![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/KV-F08080)) ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/cache-F08080) ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00) has emerged as a critical technique for
reducing the memory and latency overhead of autoregressive language models
during inference. Prior approaches predominantly rely on query-key attention
scores to rank and evict ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/cache-F08080)d tokens, assuming that attention intensity
correlates with semantic importance. However, this heuristic overlooks the
contribution of value vectors, which directly influence the attention output.
In this paper, we propose CurD![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/KV-F08080), a novel, value-centric ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/KV-F08080) ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00) method
that selects keys and values based on leverage scores computed from CUR matrix
decomposition. Our approach approximates the dominant subspace of the attention
output $softmax(QK^T)V$, ensuring that the retained tokens best preserve the
model's predictive behavior. Theoretically, we show that attention score
approximation does not guarantee output preservation, and demonstrate that
CUR-based selection minimizes end-to-end attention reconstruction loss.
Empirically, CurD![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/KV-F08080) achieves up to 9.6% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art
methods like Snap![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/KV-F08080) and Chunk![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/KV-F08080) under aggressive ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00) budgets on LLaMA
and Mistral, while maintaining compatibility with FlashAttention and Grouped
Query Attention. In addition to improved accuracy, CurD![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/KV-F08080) reduces generation
latency by up to 40% at high ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00), offering a practical speed-accuracy
tradeoff.

The upcoming generations of wireless technologies promise an era where
everything is interconnected and intelligent. As the need for intelligence
grows, networks must learn to better understand the physical world. However,
deploying dedicated hardware to perceive the environment is not always
feasible, mainly due to costs and/or complexity. Integrated Sensing and
Communication (ISAC) has made a step forward in addressing this challenge.
Within ISAC, passive sensing emerges as a cost-effective solution that reuses
wireless ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080)s to sense the environment, without interfering with
existing ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080)s. Nevertheless, the majority of current solutions are
limited to one technology (mostly Wi-Fi or 5G), constraining the maximum
accuracy reachable. As different technologies work with different spectrums, we
see a necessity in integrating more than one technology to augment the coverage
area. Hence, we take the advantage of ISAC passive sensing, to present FAWN, a
MultiEncoder Fusion-Attention Wave Network for ISAC indoor scene inference.
FAWN is based on the original ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00)s architecture, to fuse information
from Wi-Fi and 5G, making the network capable of understanding the physical
world without interfering with the current ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080). To test our solution,
we have built a prototype and integrated it in a real scenario. Results show
errors below 0.6 m around 84% of times.


## Sentinel Agents for Secure and Trustworthy Agentic AI in Multi-Agent Systems

This paper proposes a novel architectural framework aimed at enhancing
security and reliability in multi-agent systems (MAS). A central component of
this framework is a network of Sentinel Agents, functioning as a distributed
security layer that integrates techniques such as semantic analysis via large
language models (![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s), behavioral analytics, retrieval-augmented verification,
and cross-agent anomaly detection. Such agents can potentially oversee
inter-agent ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080)s, identify potential threats, enforce privacy and
access controls, and maintain comprehensive audit records. Complementary to the
idea of Sentinel Agents is the use of a Coordinator Agent. The Coordinator
Agent supervises policy implementation, and manages agent participation. In
addition, the Coordinator also ingests alerts from Sentinel Agents. Based on
these alerts, it can adapt policies, isolate or quarantine misbehaving agents,
and contain threats to maintain the integrity of the MAS ecosystem. This
dual-layered security approach, combining the continuous monitoring of Sentinel
Agents with the governance functions of Coordinator Agents, supports dynamic
and adaptive defense mechanisms against a range of threats, including prompt
injection, collusive agent behavior, hallucinations generated by ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s, privacy
breaches, and coordinated multi-agent attacks. In addition to the architectural
design, we present a simulation study where 162 synthetic attacks of different
families (prompt injection, hallucination, and data exfiltration) were injected
into a multi-agent conversational environment. The Sentinel Agents successfully
detected the attack attempts, confirming the practical feasibility of the
proposed monitoring approach. The framework also offers enhanced system
observability, supports regulatory compliance, and enables policy evolution
over time.

Social media has become a key medium of ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080) in today's society.
This realisation has led to many parties employing artificial users (or bots)
to mislead others into believing untruths or acting in a beneficial manner to
such parties. Sophisticated text generation tools, such as large language
models, have further exacerbated this issue. This paper aims to compare the
effectiveness of bot detection models based on encoder and ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080)r
![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00)s. Pipelines are developed to evaluate the performance of these
classifiers, revealing that encoder-based classifiers demonstrate greater
accuracy and robustness. However, ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080)r-based models showed greater
adaptability through task-specific alignment, suggesting more potential for
generalisation across different use cases in addition to superior observa.
These findings contribute to the ongoing effort to prevent digital environments
being manipulated while protecting the integrity of online discussion.

Experimental studies of beauty hadron decays face significant challenges due
to a wide range of backgrounds arising from the numerous possible decay
channels with similar final states. For a particular signal decay, the process
for ascertaining the most relevant background processes necessitates a detailed
analysis of final state particles, potential misidentifications, and kinematic
![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080)s, which, due to computational limitations, is restricted to the
simulation of only the most relevant backgrounds. Moreover, this process
typically relies on the physicist's intuition and expertise, as no systematic
method exists.
  This paper has two primary goals. First, from a particle physics perspective,
we present a novel approach that utilises Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
overcome the aforementioned challenges by systematically determining the
critical backgrounds affecting beauty hadron decay measurements. While beauty
hadron physics serves as the case study in this work, the proposed strategy is
broadly adaptable to other types of particle physics measurements. Second, from
a Machine Learning perspective, we introduce a novel algorithm which exploits
the synergy between RL and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for environments with
highly ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080) rewards and a large trajectory space. This strategy leverages GAs
to efficiently explore the trajectory space and identify successful
trajectories, which are used to guide the RL agent's training. Our method also
incorporates a ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00) architecture for the RL agent to handle token
sequences representing decays.

We propose Llama-Mimi, a speech language model that uses a unified tokenizer
and a single Transformer ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080)r to jointly model sequences of interleaved
semantic and acoustic tokens. Comprehensive evaluation shows that Llama-Mimi
achieves state-of-the-art performance in acoustic consistency and possesses the
ability to preserve speaker identity. Our analysis further demonstrates that
increasing the number of ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/quantize-F08080)rs improves acoustic fidelity but degrades
linguistic performance, highlighting the inherent challenge of maintaining
long-term coherence. We additionally introduce an ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)-as-a-Judge-based
evaluation to assess the spoken content quality of generated outputs. Our
models, code, and speech samples are publicly available.

Advances in self-supervised encoders have improved Visual Speech Recognition
(VSR). Recent approaches integrating these encoders with ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00) ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080)rs improves
transcription accuracy; however, it remains unclear whether these gains stem
from visual understanding or stronger language modeling. In this work, we
systematically evaluate ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00) ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080)rs by freezing or selectively updating the
visual encoder, scaling ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080)r size, comparing adaptation strategies and
architectures, and varying training data across LRS2, LRS3, and their
combination. Evaluation on LRS2, LRS3, and WildVSR shows that scaling and
adaptation yield limited improvements, while combining datasets enhances
generalization. Semantic analysis reveals that gains arise primarily from
lexical rather than semantic processing. Our Llama-2-13B model trained on the
combined set achieves 24.7\% WER on LRS3 and 47.0\% on WildVSR, establishing
SOTA among models trained without additional supervision. Our findings indicate
![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00) ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080)rs refine contextual reasoning rather than visual features,
emphasizing the need for stronger visual encoders to drive meaningful progress.


## Studying SNR-MC interactions as galactic PeVatrons in the era of CTAO and ASTRI Mini-Array

Supernova remnants (SNRs) are widely recognized as key accelerators of
Galactic cosmic rays (CRs), supported by the detection of the characteristic
pion bump in the gamma-ray spectra of several SNRs. However, the recent
observation of ultra-high-energy (UHE, greater than 100 TeV) gamma-rays by
LHAASO from sources such as W51 region challenges standard models, which
predict CR ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/acceleration-F08080) up to PeV energies only during the early (~ 100 year)
phase of SNR evolution. Given the older age of known SNRs, alternative
mechanisms - such as the interaction of runaway CRs with nearby molecular
clouds (MCs) - have been proposed to explain the persistent UHE emission. In
this study, we focus on the W51 complex, particularly the W51C-B region, as a
promising site for investigating SNR-MC interactions. Simulated observations
with the CTAO and the ASTRI Mini-Array are presented to demonstrate their
crucial role in bridging the energy gap between Fermi-LAT and LHAASO,
especially in the 0.3-100 TeV range. Their improved angular resolution will
also help disentangle emission components from the interaction zone and nearby
sources. Our theoretical modelling suggests that accelerated particles at the
shock can account for the radio and GeV data, while UHE emission could be best
explained by the combined contribution from both ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/acceleration-F08080) and adiabatic
![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00) of cloud material at the SNR-MC interface.

Deep learning has demonstrated strong capability in compressing point clouds.
Within this area, entropy modeling for lossless ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00) is widely
investigated. However, most methods rely solely on parent orsibling contexts
and level-wise autoregression, which suffers from ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080) latency on the order
of 10 to 100 seconds. We propose HINT, a method that integrates temporal and
spatial correlation for sequential point cloud ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00). Specifically, it
first uses a two stage temporal feature extraction: (i) a parent-level
existence map and (ii) a child-level neighborhood lookup in the previous frame.
These cues are fused with the spatial features via elementwise addition and
encoded with a group-wise strategy. Experimental results show that HINT
achieves encoding and ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080) time at 105 ms and 140 ms, respectively,
equivalent to 49.6x and 21.6x ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/acceleration-F08080) in comparison with G-PCC, while
achieving up to bit rate reduction of 43.6%, in addition, consistently
outperforming over the strong spatial only baseline (RENO).

This work introduces MELA-TTS, a novel joint ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00)-diffusion framework
for end-to-end text-to-speech synthesis. By autoregressively generating
continuous mel-spectrogram frames from linguistic and speaker conditions, our
architecture eliminates the need for speech tokenization and multi-stage
processing pipelines. To address the inherent difficulties of modeling
continuous features, we propose a representation alignment module that aligns
output representations of the ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00) ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080)r with semantic embeddings from
a pretrained ASR encoder during training. This mechanism not only speeds up
training convergence, but also enhances cross-modal coherence between the
textual and acoustic domains. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
MELA-TTS achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation
metrics while maintaining robust zero-shot voice cloning capabilities, in both
offline and streaming synthesis modes. Our results establish a new benchmark
for continuous feature generation approaches in TTS, offering a compelling
alternative to discrete-token-based paradigms.

Large language model (![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)) inference has been a prevalent demand in daily
life and industries. The large tensor sizes and computing complexities in ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s
have brought challenges to memory, computing, and databus. This paper proposes
a computation/memory/![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080) co-designed non-von Neumann accelerator by
aggregating processing-in-memory (PIM) and computational network-on-chip (NoC),
termed LEAP. The matrix multiplications in ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00)s are assigned to PIM or NoC
based on the data dynamicity to maximize data locality. Model partition and
mapping are optimized by heuristic design space exploration. Dedicated
fine-grained parallelism and tiling techniques enable high-throughput dataflow
across the distributed resources in PIM and NoC. The architecture is evaluated
on Llama 1B/8B/13B models and shows $\sim$2.55$\times$ throughput (tokens/sec)
improvement and $\sim$71.94$\times$ energy efficiency (tokens/Joule) boost
compared to the A100 GPU.

Light field technology is a powerful imaging method that captures both the
intensity and direction of light rays in a scene, enabling the reconstruction
of 3D information and supporting a range of unique applications. However, light
fields produce vast amounts of data, making efficient ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00) essential for
their practical use. View synthesis plays a key role in light field technology
by enabling the generation of new views, yet its interaction with ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00)
has not been fully explored. In this work, a subjective analysis of the effect
of view synthesis on light field ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00) is conducted. To achieve this, a
![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080)ly sampled light field is created by dropping views from an original
light field. Both light fields are then encoded using JPEG Pleno and VVC. View
synthesis is then applied to the compressed sampled light field to reconstruct
the same number of views as the original. The subjective evaluation follows the
proposed JPEG AIC-3 test methodology designed to assess the quality of
high-fidelity compressed images. This test consists of two test stimuli
displayed side-by-side, each alternating between an original and a coded view,
creating a flicker effect on both sides. The user must choose which side has
the stronger flicker and, therefore, the lower quality. Using these subjective
results, a selection of metrics is validated.

Boundary layers of adiabatic and isothermal curved walls are investigated for
a supersonic turbine cascade, including the effects of shock-boundary layer
interactions (SBLIs). Wall-resolved large eddy simulations (LES) are performed
for a linear cascade of blades with an inlet Mach number of $M_\infty = 2.0$
and Reynolds number based on the axial chord $Re_\infty = 200\,000$. The wall
to inlet temperature ratio of the isothermal case is $T_w/T_{\infty}=0.75$,
representing a cooled wall. An assessment of the effects of pressure gradient,
thermal boundary conditions and SBLIs is presented in terms of the downstream
variation of mean flow quantities such as density, temperature, and momentum
profiles. The different thermal boundary conditions affect the density and
temperature profiles along the boundary layer, where cooling increases the
density of the gas near the wall, and reduces its temperature and viscosity.
Both of these effects make the momentum profiles fuller and, hence, the
boundary layer of the isothermal case is less prone to separate than that of
the adiabatic wall. The mean density profiles are also affected by pressure
gradients induced by the convex and concave curvatures of the blade, which lead
to expansion and ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00) of the flow, respectively. The analysis of
separate terms from the momentum balance equation explains the behavior of
various physical mechanisms in the inner and outer regions of the supersonic
boundary layers. The importance of mean flow advection, compressibility, and
Reynolds stresses is presented in terms of flow ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/acceleration-F08080) and deceleration.
The impact of the SBLIs in the momentum balance mechanisms is also
investigated, showing that a combination of ![key](https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00)s and expansions impact
the boundary layers by redirecting the flow toward the wall due to the shock
formations.
