## Abstract

This paper presents a comprehensive review of the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture in large language models, highlighting its ability to
significantly enhance model performance while maintaining minimal computational
overhead. Through a systematic analysis spanning theoretical foundations, core
architectural designs, and large language model (LLM) applications, we examine
expert gating and routing mechanisms, hierarchical and sparse MoE
configurations, meta-learning approaches, multimodal and multitask learning
scenarios, real-world deployment cases, and recent advances and challenges in
deep learning. Our analysis identifies key advantages of MoE, including
superior model capacity compared to equivalent Bayesian approaches, improved
task-specific performance, and the ability to scale model capacity efficiently.
We also underscore the importance of ensuring expert diversity, accurate
calibration, and reliable inference aggregation, as these are essential for
maximizing the effectiveness of MoE architectures. Finally, this review
outlines current research limitations, open challenges, and promising future
directions, providing a foundation for continued innovation in MoE architecture
and its applications.
