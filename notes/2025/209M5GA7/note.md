## Abstract

Withtherapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), the context length
for inference has been continuously increasing, leading to an exponential
growth in the demand for Key-Value (KV) caching. This has resulted in a
significant memory bottleneck, limiting the inference efficiency and
scalability of the models. Therefore, optimizing the KV cache during inference
is crucial for enhancing performance and efficiency. This review systematically
examines current KV cache optimization techniques, including compression
strategies such as selective token strategies, quantization, and attention
compression. We evaluate the effectiveness, trade-offs, and application
scenarios of these methods, providing a comprehensive analysis of their impact
on memory usage and inference speed. We focus on identifying the limitations
and challenges of existing methods, such as compatibility issues with different
models and tasks. Additionally, this review highlights future research
directions, including hybrid optimization techniques, adaptive dynamic
strategies, and software-hardware co-design. These approaches aim to improve
inference efficiency and promote the practical application of large language
models.
