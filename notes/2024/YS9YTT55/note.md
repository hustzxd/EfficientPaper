## Abstract

This survey offers a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in Large
Language Model (LLM) serving systems, focusing on research since the year 2023.
We specifically examine system-level enhancements that improve performance and
efficiency without altering the core LLM decoding mechanisms. By selecting and
reviewing high-quality papers from prestigious ML and system venues, we
highlight key innovations and practical considerations for deploying and
scaling LLMs in real-world production environments. This survey serves as a
valuable resource for LLM practitioners seeking to stay abreast of the latest
developments in this rapidly evolving field.
