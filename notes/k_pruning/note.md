## Method
- Key idea
  - **Selecting pruning targets**
    - Neurons and attention heads that minimally reduce the PLMâ€™s knowledge
  - **Iterative pruning**
    - Use knowledge reconstruction for each sub-layer to handle the distorted inputs by pruning.
- K-pruning (Knowledge-preserving pruning)
  - knowledge measurement
  - knowledge-preserving mask search
