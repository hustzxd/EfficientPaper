<p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models adapt large vision-language backbones to
map images and instructions to robot actions. However, prevailing VLA <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>rs
either generate actions autoregressively in a fixed left-to-right order or
attach continuous diffusion or flow matching heads outside the backbone,
demanding specialized training and iterative sampling that hinder a unified,
scalable architecture. We present Discrete Diffusion VLA, a single-<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a>
policy that models discretized action chunks with discrete diffusion and is
trained with the same cross-entropy objective as the VLM backbone. The design
retains diffusion's progressive refinement paradigm while remaining natively
compatible with the discrete token interface of VLMs. Our method achieves an
adaptive <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080" /></a> order that resolves easy action elements before harder ones
and uses secondary remasking to revisit uncertain predictions across refinement
rounds, which improves consistency and enables robust error correction. This
unified <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>r preserves pretrained vision language priors, supports parallel

function evaluations. Discrete Diffusion VLA achieves 96.3% avg. SR on LIBERO,
71.2% visual matching on SimplerEnv Fractal and 49.3% overall on SimplerEnv
Bridge, improving over both autoregressive and continuous diffusion baselines.
These findings indicate that discrete-diffusion action <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>r supports precise
action modeling and consistent training, laying groundwork for scaling VLA to
larger models and datasets.</p>

topologies, and limited adaptability. To address these challenges, we introduce
Symphony, a decentralized multi-agent system which enables lightweight <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s on
consumer-grade GPUs to coordinate. Symphony introduces three key mechanisms:
(1) a decentralized ledger that records capabilities, (2) a Beacon-selection
protocol for dynamic task allocation, and (3) weighted result voting based on
CoTs. This design forms a privacy-saving, scalable, and fault-tolerant
orchestration with low overhead. Empirically, Symphony outperforms existing
baselines on reasoning benchmarks, achieving substantial accuracy gains and
demonstrating robustness across models of varying capacities.</p>

``never trust, always verify'' principle. We begin by systematically analyzing
the security risks in multi-<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> systems within EGI contexts. Subsequently, we

Particularly, we categorize zero-trust security mechanisms into model- and
system-level approaches. The former and latter include strong identification,
context-aware access control, etc., and proactive maintenance, blockchain-based

directions. This survey serves as the first systematic treatment of zero-trust

<p>Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition is foundational for
educational technologies, enabling applications like digital note-taking and
automated grading. While modern encoder-<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>r architectures with large
language models excel at LaTeX generation, they lack explicit symbol-to-trace
alignment, a critical limitation for error analysis, interpretability, and
spatially aware interactive applications requiring selective content updates.
This paper introduces a structural recognition approach with two innovations: 1
an automatic annotation system that uses a neural network to map LaTeX
equations to raw traces, automatically generating annotations for symbol
segmentation, classification, and spatial relations, and 2 a modular structural
recognition system that independently optimizes segmentation, classification,
and relation prediction. By leveraging a dataset enriched with structural
annotations from our auto-labeling system, the proposed recognition system
combines graph-based trace sorting, a hybrid convolutional-recurrent network,
and <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a>-based correction to achieve competitive performance on the
CROHME-2023 benchmark. Crucially, our structural recognition system generates a
complete graph structure that directly links handwritten traces to predicted
symbols, enabling transparent error analysis and interpretable outputs.</p>

<p>Ambient intelligence (AmI) is a computing paradigm in which physical
environments are embedded with sensing, computation, and <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" /></a> so they
can perceive people and context, decide appropriate actions, and respond
autonomously. Realizing AmI at global scale requires sixth generation (6G)
wireless networks with capabilities for real time perception, reasoning, and
action aligned with human behavior and mobility patterns. We argue that
Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is the creative core of such
environments. Unlike traditional AI, GenAI learns data distributions and can
generate realistic samples, making it well suited to close key AmI gaps,
including generating synthetic sensor and channel data in under observed areas,
translating user intent into compact, semantic messages, predicting future
network conditions for proactive control, and updating digital twins without
compromising privacy.
  This chapter reviews foundational GenAI models, GANs, VAEs, diffusion models,
and generative <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a>s, and connects them to practical AmI use cases,
including spectrum sharing, ultra reliable low latency <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" /></a>,
intelligent security, and context aware digital twins. We also examine how 6G
enablers, such as edge and fog computing, IoT device swarms, intelligent
reflecting surfaces (IRS), and non terrestrial networks, can host or accelerate
distributed GenAI. Finally, we outline open challenges in energy efficient on
device training, trustworthy synthetic data, federated generative learning, and
AmI specific standardization. We show that GenAI is not a peripheral addition,
but a foundational element for transforming 6G from a faster network into an
ambient intelligent ecosystem.</p>

succeeds, while 7 or fewer completely fails, revealing sharp computational

for machines. Despite its broadness, most existing research on computational
humor traditionally focused on modeling a specific type of humor. In this work,
we wish to understand whether competence on one or more specific humor tasks
confers any ability to transfer to novel, unseen types; in other words, is this
fragmentation inevitable? This question is especially timely as new humor types
continuously emerge in online and social media contexts (e.g., memes,
anti-humor, AI fails). If Large Language Models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s) are to keep up with this
evolving landscape, they must be able to generalize across humor types by
capturing deeper, transferable mechanisms. To investigate this, we conduct a
series of transfer learning experiments across four datasets, representing
different humor tasks. We train <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s under varied diversity settings (1-3
datasets in training, testing on a novel task). Experiments reveal that models
are capable of some transfer, and can reach up to 75% accuracy on unseen
datasets; training on diverse sources improves transferability (1.88-4.05%)
with minimal-to-no drop in in-domain performance. Further analysis suggests
relations between humor types, with Dad Jokes surprisingly emerging as the best
enabler of transfer (but is difficult to transfer to). We release data and

recent studies show impressive encoding performance in point-to-point

Moreover, the few studies to investigate this consider a centralized
collision-free approach, where a central scheduler decides the transmission
order of the nodes. In this work, we address the Goal-oriented Multiple Access
(GoMA) problem, in which multiple intelligent agents must coordinate to share a
wireless channel and avoid mutual interference. We propose a theoretical
framework for the analysis and optimization of distributed GoMA, <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00" /></a> as a
first step towards its complete characterization. We prove that the problem is
non-convex and may admit multiple Nash Equilibrium (NE) solutions. We provide a
characterization of each node's best response to others' strategies and propose
an optimization approach that provably reaches one such NE, outperforming
centralized approaches by up to 100% while also reducing energy consumption. We

<p>Accurate detection and segmentation of cancerous lesions from computed

treatment response assessment. Transformer-based models with self-supervised
pretraining can produce reliably accurate segmentation from in-distribution

address this challenge with RF-Deep, a random forest classifier that utilizes

model comprises a Swin Transformer encoder, pretrained with masked image
modeling (SimMIM) on 10,432 unlabeled 3D CT scans covering cancerous and
non-cancerous conditions, with a convolution <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>r, trained to segment lung

datasets that included one ID dataset and four OOD datasets comprising chest
CTs with pulmonary embolism (PE) and COVID-19, and abdominal CTs with kidney
cancers and healthy volunteers. RF-Deep detected OOD cases with a FPR95 of
18.26%, 27.66%, and less than 0.1% on PE, COVID-19, and abdominal CTs,
consistently outperforming established OOD approaches. The RF-Deep classifier

However, they cannot achieve desired performance due to impractical system
assumptions and a lack of consideration for MoE-specific characteristics. In
this paper, we propose FLUX, a system designed to enable federated fine-tuning
of MoE-based <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s across participants with constrained computing resources
(e.g., consumer-grade GPUs), aiming to minimize time-to-accuracy. FLUX
introduces three key innovations: (1) <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080" /></a>-based local profiling to

(3) dynamic expert role assignment using an exploration-exploitation strategy

<p>We introduce the Concurrent Modular Agent (CMA), a framework that

fully asynchronously yet maintain a coherent and fault-tolerant behavioral
loop. This framework addresses long-standing difficulties in agent
architectures by letting intention emerge from language-mediated interactions
among autonomous processes. This approach enables flexible, adaptive, and
context-dependent behavior through the combination of concurrently executed
modules that offload reasoning to an <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>, inter-module <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" /></a>, and a
single shared global state.We consider this approach to be a practical
realization of Minsky's Society of Mind theory. We demonstrate the viability of
our system through two practical use-case studies. The emergent properties
observed in our system suggest that complex cognitive phenomena like
self-awareness may indeed arise from the organized interaction of simpler
processes, supporting Minsky-Society of Mind concept and opening new avenues

<p>Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a>-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a>

masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.</p>

<p>The primary goal of traditional federated learning is to protect data privacy
by enabling distributed edge devices to collaboratively train a shared global
model while keeping raw data decentralized at local clients. The rise of large
language models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s) has introduced new challenges in distributed systems, as
their substantial computational requirements and the need for specialized
expertise raise critical concerns about protecting intellectual property (IP).
This highlights the need for a federated learning approach that can safeguard
both sensitive data and proprietary models. To tackle this challenge, we
propose FedQSN, a federated learning approach that leverages random masking to
obscure a subnetwork of model parameters and applies <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080" /></a> to the

reinforcement training - a two-stage paradigm combining structured knowledge
distillation from advanced reasoning models with preference-aligned reward

<p>While Mixture of Experts (MoE) models achieve remarkable efficiency by
activating only subsets of parameters, they suffer from high memory access
costs during inference. Memory-layer architectures offer an appealing
alternative with very few memory access, but previous attempts like UltraMem
have only matched the performance of 2-expert MoE models, falling significantly
short of state-of-the-art 8-expert configurations. We present UltraMemV2, a
redesigned memory-layer architecture that closes this performance gap. Our
approach introduces five key improvements: integrating memory layers into every

adopting FFN-based value processing from PEER, implementing principled
parameter initialization, and rebalancing memory-to-FFN computation ratios.
Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that UltraMemV2 achieves
performance parity with 8-expert MoE models under same computation and
parameters but significantly low memory access. Notably, UltraMemV2 shows
superior performance on memory-intensive tasks, with improvements of +1.6
points on long-context memorization, +6.2 points on multi-round memorization,
and +7.9 points on in-context learning. We validate our approach at scale with

<p>Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, pre<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00" /></a> geometric

Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>r <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a> architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and

distinct capability regimes: memorization and reasoning. We train families of
MoE Transformers that systematically vary total parameters, active parameters,
and top-<script type="math/tex">k</script> routing while holding the compute budget fixed. For every model we
record pre-training loss, downstream task loss, and task accuracy, allowing us
to separate the train-test generalization gap from the loss-accuracy gap.
Memorization benchmarks improve monotonically with total parameters, mirroring
training loss. By contrast, reasoning performance saturates and can even
regress despite continued gains in both total parameters and training loss.
Altering top-<script type="math/tex">k</script> alone has little effect when active parameters are constant,
and classic hyperparameters such as learning rate and initialization modulate

<p>With the recent rapid advancement of Agentic Intelligence, agentic tool use
in <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s has become increasingly important. During multi-turn interactions
between agents and users, the dynamic, uncertain, and stochastic nature of user
demands poses significant challenges to the agent's tool invocation
capabilities. Agents are no longer expected to simply call tools to deliver a
result; rather, they must iteratively refine their understanding of user needs
through <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" /></a> while simultaneously invoking tools to resolve user
queries. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for tool use lack the
integration of genuinely dynamic users during the RL training process. To
bridge this gap, we introduce MUA-RL (Multi-turn User-interacting Agent
Reinforcement Learning for agentic tool use), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that, for the first time in the field of agentic tool use, integrates
<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>-simulated users into the reinforcement learning loop. MUA-RL aims to enable
autonomous learning of models to communicate with users efficiently and use
various tools to solve practical problems in dynamic multi-turn interactions.
Evaluations are done on several multi-turn tool-using benchmarks (see Figure
1). Specifically, MUA-RL-32B achieves 67.3 on TAU2 Retail, 45.4 on TAU2
Airline, 28.3 on TAU2 Telecom, 28.4 on BFCL-V3 Multi Turn, and 82.5 on ACEBench

learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s. Unlike traditional pre-training approaches, RL
encompasses multiple stages: rollout, reward, and training, which necessitates
collaboration among various worker types. However, current RL systems continue
to grapple with substantial GPU underutilization, due to two primary factors:
(1) The rollout stage dominates the overall RL process due to test-time
scaling; (2) Imbalances in rollout lengths (within the same batch) result in
GPU bubbles. While prior solutions like asynchronous execution and truncation
offer partial relief, they may compromise training accuracy for efficiency.
  Our key insight stems from a previously overlooked observation: rollout
responses exhibit remarkable similarity across adjacent training epochs. Based
on the insight, we introduce RhymeRL, an <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> RL system designed to accelerate
RL training with two key innovations. First, to enhance rollout generation, we

similarity of historical rollout token sequences to obtain accurate drafts.
Second, to tackle rollout bubbles, we introduce HistoPipe, a two-tier
scheduling strategy that leverages the similarity of historical rollout
distributions to balance workload among rollout workers. We have evaluated
RhymeRL within a real production environment, demonstrating scalability from
dozens to thousands of GPUs. Experimental results demonstrate that RhymeRL
achieves a 2.6x performance improvement over existing methods, without
compromising accuracy or modifying the RL paradigm.</p>

<p>This paper explores the combination of two intrinsic motivation strategies to
improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in environments

infrequent positive feedback. We propose integrating Variational State as
Intrinsic Reward (VSIMR), which uses Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) to reward
state novelty, with an intrinsic reward approach derived from Large Language
Models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s). The <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s leverage their pre-trained knowledge to generate reward
signals based on environment and goal descriptions, guiding the agent. We
implemented this combined approach with an Actor-Critic (A2C) agent in the
MiniGrid DoorKey environment, a benchmark for <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> rewards. Our empirical
results show that this combined strategy significantly increases agent
performance and sampling efficiency compared to using each strategy
individually or a standard A2C agent, which failed to learn. Analysis of
learning curves indicates that the combination effectively complements
different aspects of the environment and task: VSIMR drives exploration of new
states, while the <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>-derived rewards facilitate progressive exploitation

inconsistent outputs, particularly on complex or long-form questions.
Self-Consistency (SC) mitigates this for short-form QA by majority voting over
exact strings, whereas Universal Self-Consistency (USC) and Weighted Unigram
Consistency Score (WUCS) extend to long-form responses but lose accuracy on
short-form benchmarks.
  We introduce Latent Self-Consistency (LSC), which selects the most
semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. A
lightweight forward generation of summary tokens increases inference time by
less than 1% and requires no changes to the model architecture.
  Across 6 short-form and 5 long-form reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MATH, MMLU,
TruthfulQA), LSC surpasses SC, USC and WUCS on all short-form and long-form
ones on average, while maintaining negligible computational overhead. These
results position LSC as a practical consistency-selection method that works
reliably across answer formats. Additionally, LSC provides well-calibrated
confidence estimates, maintaining low Expected Calibration Error across both
answer formats.</p>

Guardrails technologies aim to mitigate this risk by filtering <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s'

<p>Mixture of Experts (MoE) has become a mainstream architecture for building

model scaling. It can be viewed as partitioning a large Feed-Forward Network
(FFN) at the tensor level into fine-grained sub-FFNs, or experts, and
activating only a <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> subset for each input. While this <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" /></a> improves
efficiency, MoE still faces substantial challenges due to their massive
computational scale and unpredictable activation patterns.
  To enable efficient MoE deployment, we identify dual <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" /></a> at the tensor
and neuron levels in pre-trained MoE modules as a key factor for both accuracy
and efficiency. Unlike prior work that increases tensor-level <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" /></a> through
finer-grained expert design during pre-training, we introduce post-training
expert partitioning to induce such <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" /></a> without retraining. This preserves
the mathematical consistency of model transformations and enhances both
efficiency and accuracy in subsequent fine-tuning and inference. Building upon
this, we propose DualSparse-MoE, an inference system that integrates dynamic
tensor-level computation dropping with static neuron-level reconstruction to
deliver significant efficiency gains with minimal accuracy loss.
  Experimental results show that enforcing an approximate 25% drop rate with
our approach reduces average accuracy by only 0.08%-0.28% across three
prevailing MoE models, while nearly all degrees of computation dropping
consistently yield proportional computational speedups. Furthermore,
incorporating load-imbalance awareness into expert parallelism achieves a 1.41x
MoE module speedup with just 0.5% average accuracy degradation.</p>

<p>Translating natural languages into sign languages is a highly complex and
underexplored task. Despite growing interest in accessibility and inclusivity,
the development of robust translation systems remains hindered by the limited
availability of parallel corpora which align natural language with sign
language data. Existing methods often struggle to generalize in these
data-scarce environments, as the few datasets available are typically
domain-specific, lack standardization, or fail to capture the full linguistic
richness of sign languages. To address this limitation, we propose Advanced Use
of <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s for Sign Language Translation (AulSign), a novel method that leverages
Large Language Models via dynamic prompting and in-context learning with sample
selection and subsequent sign association. Despite their impressive abilities
in processing text, <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s lack intrinsic knowledge of sign languages; therefore,
they are unable to natively perform this kind of translation. To overcome this
limitation, we associate the signs with compact descriptions in natural
language and instruct the model to use them. We evaluate our method on both
English and Italian languages using SignBank+, a recognized benchmark in the
field, as well as the Italian LaCAM CNR-ISTC dataset. We demonstrate superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art models in low-data scenario. Our
findings demonstrate the effectiveness of AulSign, with the potential to

promising results, they often fail to fully exploit computational clusters

method that combines Multi-Instance Training (MIT), Adaptive Batched DiLoCo,
and switch mode mechanism. MIT allows individual nodes to run multiple
lightweight training streams with different model instances in parallel and
merge them to combine knowledge, increasing throughput and reducing idle time.

Switch mode further stabilizes training by seamlessly introducing gradient
accumulation once adaptive batch sizes grow beyond hardware-friendly limits.
Together, these innovations improve both convergence speed and system

<p>AI-generated content technologies are widely used in content creation.
However, current AIGC systems rely heavily on creators' inspiration, rarely
generating truly user-personalized content. In real-world applications such as
online advertising, a single product may have multiple selling points, with
different users focusing on different features. This underscores the
significant value of personalized, user-centric creative generation. Effective
personalized content generation faces two main challenges: (1) accurately
modeling user interests and integrating them into the content generation
process while adhering to factual constraints, and (2) ensuring high efficiency
and scalability to handle the massive user base in industrial scenarios.
Additionally, the scarcity of personalized creative data in practice

employed to significantly enhance generation efficiency and reduce
computational overhead, making the approach suitable for large-scale

<p>The increasing adoption of large language models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s) in software
engineering necessitates rigorous security evaluation of their generated code.
However, existing benchmarks are inadequate, as they focus on isolated code
snippets, employ unstable evaluation methods that lack reproducibility, and
fail to connect the quality of input context with the security of the output.
To address these gaps, we introduce A.S.E (AI Code Generation Security
Evaluation), a benchmark for repository-level secure code generation. A.S.E
constructs tasks from real-world repositories with documented CVEs, pre<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00" /></a>

primarily due to their short effective context length, quadratic computational

<p>As queries in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines powered by large

models have demonstrated strong performance in semantic matching. Nevertheless,
they often struggle with fine-grained retrieval tasks, where precise keyword
alignment and span-level localization are required, even in cases with high
lexical <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" /></a> that would intuitively suggest easier retrieval. To
systematically evaluate this limitation, we introduce two targeted tasks,
keyword retrieval and part-of-passage retrieval, designed to simulate practical
fine-grained scenarios. Motivated by these observations, we propose
LexSemBridge, a unified framework that enhances dense query representations
through fine-grained, input-aware vector modulation. LexSemBridge constructs
latent enhancement vectors from input tokens using three paradigms: Statistical
(SLR), Learned (LLR), and Contextual (CLR), and integrates them with dense
embeddings via element-wise interaction. Theoretically, we show that this
modulation preserves the semantic direction while selectively amplifying
discriminative dimensions. LexSemBridge operates as a plug-in without modifying
the backbone encoder and naturally extends to both text and vision modalities.
Extensive experiments across semantic and fine-grained retrieval tasks validate
the effectiveness and generality of our approach. All code and models are
publicly available at https://github.com/Jasaxion/LexSemBridge/</p>

handle the challenge of different model capacities. The output token is then
sampled from a new distribution that combines the distributions of the original

the large model with the desired safety property, and also allows the model to
remain helpful to benign queries. Furthermore, SSD accelerates the inference

<p>Automated colonic polyp segmentation is crucial for assisting doctors in
screening of precancerous polyps and diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms.
Although existing methods have achieved promising results, polyp segmentation
remains hindered by the following limitations,including: (1) significant
variation in polyp shapes and sizes, (2) indistinct boundaries between polyps
and adjacent tissues, and (3) small-sized polyps are easily overlooked during
the segmentation process. Driven by these practical difficulties, an innovative
architecture, CMFDNet, is proposed with the CMD module, MSA module, and FD
module. The CMD module, <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00" /></a> as an innovative <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>r, introduces a
cross-scanning method to reduce blurry boundaries. The MSA module adopts a
multi-branch parallel structure to enhance the recognition ability for polyps
with diverse geometries and scale distributions. The FD module establishes
dependencies among all <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>r features to alleviate the under-detection of
polyps with small-scale features. Experimental results show that CMFDNet
outperforms six SOTA methods used for comparison, especially on ETIS and
ColonDB datasets, where mDice scores exceed the best SOTA method by 1.83% and
1.55%, respectively.</p>

resolves conflict by utilizing confidence-aware measures (entropy gap and
contextual peakedness) and the generalized divergence between the parametric

even in low conflict settings. Extensive experiments across multiple <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s on
diverse Question Answering (QA), Summarization, and Long-Form Question
Answering (LFQA) benchmarks demonstrate CoCoA's state-of-the-art performance
over strong baselines like AdaCAD. It yields significant gains in QA accuracy,
up to 9.2 points on average compared to the strong baseline AdaCAD, and
improves factuality in summarization and LFQA by up to 2.5 points on average
across key benchmarks. Additionally, it demonstrates superior sensitivity to
conflict variations. CoCoA enables more informed, context-aware, and ultimately
more faithful token generation.</p>
