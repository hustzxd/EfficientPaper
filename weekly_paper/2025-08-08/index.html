<p>Misleading visualizations pose a significant challenge to accurate data
interpretation. While recent research has explored the use of Large Language
Models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s) for detecting such misinformation, practical tools that also
support explanation and correction remain limited. We present MisVisFix, an
interactive dashboard that leverages both Claude and GPT models to support the
full workflow of detecting, explaining, and correcting misleading
visualizations. MisVisFix correctly identifies 96% of visualization issues and
addresses all 74 known visualization misinformation types, classifying them as
major, minor, or potential concerns. It provides detailed explanations,
actionable suggestions, and automatically generates corrected charts. An
interactive chat interface allows users to ask about specific chart elements or
request modifications. The dashboard adapts to newly emerging misinformation
strategies through targeted user interactions. User studies with visualization
experts and developers of fact-checking tools show that MisVisFix accurately
identifies issues and offers useful suggestions for improvement. By
transforming <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>-based detection into an accessible, interactive platform,
MisVisFix advances visualization literacy and supports more trustworthy data

when processing long contexts due to proactive interference, where irrelevant
information in earlier parts of the context disrupts reasoning and memory
recall. While most research focuses on external memory systems to augment <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s'
capabilities, we propose a complementary approach: empowering <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s with Active
Context Management (ACM) tools to actively sculpt their internal working
memory. We introduce Sculptor, a framework that equips <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s with three
categories of tools: (1) context fragmentation, (2) summary, hide, and restore,
and (3) intelligent search. Our approach enables <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s to proactively manage
their attention and working memory, analogous to how humans selectively focus
on relevant information while filtering out distractions. Experimental
evaluation on information-<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> benchmarks-PI-<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> (proactive interference) and
NeedleBench Multi-Needle Reasoning-demonstrates that Sculptor significantly
improves performance even without specific training, leveraging <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s' inherent
tool calling generalization capabilities. By enabling Active Context
Management, Sculptor not only mitigates proactive interference but also
provides a cognitive foundation for more reliable reasoning across diverse
long-context tasks-highlighting that explicit context-control strategies,
rather than merely larger token windows, are key to robustness at scale.</p>

Our approach decomposes attention projection
matrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's
parameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods
requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in
Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers
- and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix
atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves
better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA),
low-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at
comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the
dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing
cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT),
MASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks
with 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning
strategies with <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a> efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for

offer a promising approach for augmenting <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s with external, interpretable

<p>Speculative decoding (SD), where an extra draft model first provides multiple
draft tokens and the original target model then verifies these tokens in
parallel, has shown great power for <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> inference <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/acceleration-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/acceleration-F08080" /></a>. However,
existing SD methods must adhere to the 'draft-then-verify' paradigm, which
forces drafting and verification processes to execute sequentially during SD,
resulting in inefficient inference performance and limiting the size of the
draft model. Furthermore, once a single token in the candidate sequence is
rejected during the drafting process, all subsequent candidate tokens must be
discarded, leading to inefficient drafting. To address these challenges, we
propose a cache-based parallel speculative decoding framework employing a
'query-and-correct' paradigm. Specifically, CARD decouples drafting and
verification: the draft model generates candidate tokens to populate a shared
cache, while the target model concurrently rectifies the draft model's
generation direction. This effectively enables the target model to perform
inference at speed approaching that of the draft model. Our approach achieves
up to 4.83 speedup over vanilla decoding without requiring fine-tuning of
either the draft or target models. Our code is available at

  In this paper, we propose FlexQ, a novel post-training INT6 quantization
framework combining algorithmic innovation with system-level optimizations.
FlexQ employs uniform 6-bit weight quantization across all layers, with
adaptive retention of 8-bit activations in layers identified through layer-wise
sensitivity analysis. To maximize hardware efficiency, we develop a specialized
high-performance GPU kernel supporting matrix multiplication for W6A6 and W6A8
representations via Binary Tensor Core (BTC) equivalents, effectively bypassing
the lack of native INT6 tensor cores. Evaluations on LLaMA models show FlexQ
maintains near-FP16 accuracy, with perplexity increases of no more than 0.05.

vector quantization to generate discrete codes, which connect similar users and

<p>Underwater image enhancement (UIE) techniques aim to improve visual quality
of images captured in aquatic environments by addressing degradation issues
caused by light absorption and scattering effects, including color distortion,
blurring, and low contrast. Current mainstream solutions predominantly employ
multi-scale feature extraction (MSFE) mechanisms to enhance reconstruction
quality through multi-resolution feature fusion. However, our extensive
experiments demonstrate that high-quality image reconstruction does not
necessarily rely on multi-scale feature fusion. Contrary to popular belief, our
experiments show that single-scale feature extraction alone can match or
surpass the performance of multi-scale methods, significantly reducing
complexity. To comprehensively explore single-scale feature potential in
underwater enhancement, we propose an innovative Single-Scale Decomposition
Network (SSD-Net). This architecture introduces an asymmetrical decomposition
mechanism that disentangles input image into clean layer along with degradation
layer. The former contains scene-intrinsic information and the latter encodes
medium-induced interference. It uniquely combines CNN's local feature
extraction capabilities with Transformer's global modeling strengths through
two core modules: 1) Parallel Feature Decomposition Block (PFDB), implementing
dual-branch feature space decoupling via efficient attention operations and
adaptive <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a>; 2) Bidirectional Feature Communication Block
(BFCB), enabling cross-layer residual interactions for complementary feature
mining and fusion. This synergistic design preserves feature decomposition
independence while establishing dynamic cross-layer information pathways,

in medical image segmentation due to their superior ability to capture
long-range dependencies. However, these methods typically suffer from two major
limitations. First, their computational complexity scales quadratically with
the input sequences. Second, the feed-forward network (FFN) modules in vanilla
Transformers typically rely on fully connected layers, which limits models'
ability to capture local contextual information and multiscale features
critical for precise semantic segmentation. To address these issues, we propose
an efficient medical image segmentation network, named TCSAFormer. The proposed
TCSAFormer adopts two key ideas. First, it incorporates a Compressed Attention
(CA) module, which combines token compression and pixel-level <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> attention
to dynamically focus on the most relevant key-value pairs for each query. This
is achieved by <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080" /></a> globally irrelevant tokens and merging redundant ones,
significantly reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's
ability to capture relationships between tokens. Second, it introduces a
Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network (DBFFN) module as a replacement for the
standard FFN to capture local contextual features and multiscale information,
thereby strengthening the model's feature representation capability. We conduct
extensive experiments on three publicly available medical image segmentation
datasets: ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, and Synapse, to evaluate the segmentation
performance of TCSAFormer. Experimental results demonstrate that TCSAFormer
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, while maintaining lower computational overhead, thus achieving an
optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.</p>

<p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a cornerstone technique for

current RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently
retrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be
resolved using the <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>'s parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk
retrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> information
signals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive
Information Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that
integrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether
to retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs
a dual-path generation mechanism: First, the <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> produces both a direct answer
and a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these
outputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically
improving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a
dual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and
self-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information
Selection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to
both sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance
efficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy
through contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection.
Experimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS
reduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries)
while still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior
baselines on average.</p>

significant computational costs. Quantization offers a promising solution by
reducing memory usage and accelerating inference. Nonetheless, we observe that
the joint modeling of spatial and temporal information in video diffusion

propose S<script type="math/tex">^2</script>Q-VDiT, a post-training quantization framework for V-DMs that
leverages Salient data and Sparse token distillation. During the calibration

choice of calibration data. To mitigate this, we introduce
\textit{Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection}, which constructs high-quality
calibration datasets by considering both diffusion and quantization
characteristics unique to V-DMs. To tackle the learning challenges, we further
analyze the <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> attention patterns inherent in V-DMs. Based on this

distribution of multi-source data that hinders the capture of logical
relationships and the inherent inconsistencies among different sources that
lead to information conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose
MultiRAG, a novel framework designed to mitigate hallucination in multi-source
retrieval-augmented generation through knowledge-guided approaches. Our
framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a knowledge construction module
that employs multi-source line graphs to efficiently aggregate logical
relationships across different knowledge sources, effectively addressing the

implements a multi-level confidence calculation mechanism, performing both
graph-level and node-level assessments to identify and eliminate unreliable
information nodes, thereby reducing hallucinations caused by inter-source
inconsistencies. Extensive experiments on four multi-domain query datasets and
two multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that MultiRAG significantly enhances the
reliability and efficiency of knowledge retrieval in complex multi-source

ambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system
behaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data
dependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and
handle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code
generation framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal
specifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified
Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented
architectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating
decision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural
relationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously
eliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data
flow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI
systematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual
code synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained
mathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with

low entropy are indeed highly redundant. Our experiments reveal that an

converge to the conversation's style, often significantly overfitting relative
to the human baseline. While convergence patterns are often feature-specific,
we observe consistent shifts in convergence across modeling settings, with
instruction-tuned and larger models converging less than their pretrained
counterparts. Given the differences between human and model convergence
patterns, we hypothesize that the underlying mechanisms for these behaviors are
very different.</p>

<p>We present an approach to modeling annotator disagreement in subjective NLP
tasks through both architectural and data-centric innovations. Our model,
DEM-MoE (Demographic-Aware Mixture of Experts), routes inputs to expert
subnetworks based on annotator demographics, enabling it to better represent
structured, group-level variation compared to prior models. DEM-MoE
consistently performs competitively across demographic groups, and shows
especially strong results on datasets with high annotator disagreement. To

annotations via zero-shot persona prompting can be used for data imputation. We
show these synthetic judgments align moderately well with human annotations on

propose and evaluate approaches for blending real and synthetic data using
strategies tailored to dataset structure. We find that the optimal strategies

<p>Automated annotation of clinical text with standardized medical concepts is
critical for enabling structured data extraction and decision support. SNOMED
CT provides a rich ontology for labeling clinical entities, but manual
annotation is labor-intensive and impractical at scale. This study introduces a
neural sequence labeling approach for SNOMED CT concept recognition using a
Bidirectional GRU model. Leveraging a subset of MIMIC-IV, we preprocess text
with domain-adapted SpaCy and SciBERT-based tokenization, segmenting sentences
into <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" /></a>ping 19-token chunks enriched with contextual, syntactic, and
morphological features. The Bi-GRU model assigns IOB tags to identify concept
spans and achieves strong performance with a 90 percent F1-score on the
validation set. These results surpass traditional rule-based systems and match
or exceed existing neural models. Qualitative analysis shows effective handling
of ambiguous terms and misspellings. Our findings highlight that lightweight
RNN-based architectures can deliver high-quality clinical concept annotation

brings new challenges. It requires new execution models, scalable scheduling,

<p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) plays a critical role in user-generated
content (UGC) platforms, but its effectiveness depends heavily on accurate
relevance assessment of query-document pairs. Despite recent advances in
applying large language models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s) to relevance modeling, UGC platforms
present unique challenges: 1) ambiguous user intent due to <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> user feedback
in RAG scenarios, and 2) substantial noise introduced by informal and
unstructured language. To address these issues, we propose the Reinforced
Reasoning Model for Relevance Assessment (R3A), which introduces a decomposed
reasoning framework over queries and candidate documents before scoring. R3A
first leverages auxiliary high-ranked documents within the platform to infer
latent query intent. It then performs verbatim fragment extraction to justify
relevance decisions, thereby reducing errors caused by noisy UGC. Based on a
reinforcement learning framework, R3A is optimized to mitigate distortions
arising from ambiguous queries and unstructured content. Experimental results
show that R3A significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of
relevance accuracy, across both offline benchmarks and online experiments.</p>

self-exploration and iteration of reinforced large language models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s) with
expert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared to traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) and recent <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers
three significant advantages. First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot
generalisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and
out-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control
policies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is
lightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling
large-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC
process and facilitates multi-intersection <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" /></a> through its

benchmarks demonstrate that Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art,
outperforming strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In
practice, the model now manages signals for more than 55,000 drivers daily,
shortening average queues by over 5% and halving operator workload. Our

introducing micro-expert as a finer-grained compression unit that spans across

uncovers significant variance in micro-expert contributions during decoding.

<p>Language and culture are deeply intertwined, yet it is so far unclear how and
where multilingual large language models encode culture. Here, we extend upon
an established methodology for identifying language-specific neurons and extend
it to localize and isolate culture-specific neurons, carefully disentangling
their <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" /></a> and interaction with language-specific neurons. To facilitate our

predominantly in upper layers, and that these culture neurons can be modulated
independently from language-specific neurons or those specific to other
cultures. These findings suggest that cultural knowledge and propensities in
multilingual language models can be selectively isolated and edited - promoting

<p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
visual generation tasks. However, their low inference speed limits their
deployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches
exploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past
representations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer
instead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.
However, its module-level prediction across all <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a> blocks (e.g.,
attention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate
features, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it
adopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of
predictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when
prediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to
better leverage Taylor-based <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/acceleration-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/acceleration-F08080" /></a>. First, we shift the Taylor
prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly
reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong
sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error
between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an
indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor
prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation,
thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our
method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x

\textcolor{black}{channel-noise-robust} LSM-powered SC. The framework addresses
two key challenges: determining optimal compact model architectures and
effectively transferring knowledge while maintaining robustness against channel
noise. First, a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable
architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm
integrates knowledge distillation loss and a complexity penalty into the neural
architecture search process to identify high-performance, lightweight semantic
encoder architectures. Second, a novel two-stage robust knowledge distillation
(RKD) algorithm is developed to transfer semantic capabilities from an LSM

robustness. To further improve resilience to channel impairments, a

However, despite the widespread research interest and industrial application of
agent systems, these systems, like their traditional counterparts, frequently
encounter anomalies. These anomalies lead to instability and insecurity,
hindering their further development. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic
approach to the operation and maintenance of agent systems is urgently needed.

interference -- and geodesic separation -- which encourages disjoint update
geometry. We curate DriftCaps, a targeted diagnostic benchmark of safe and
unsafe prompts designed to quantify alignment drift and safety degradation.
Empirical evaluations show that AGL mitigates alignment drift by up to 50% on
safety-critical benchmarks without degrading downstream task performance.
Comprehensive ablation confirms that each component contributes distinctly to
preserving latent safety behaviors. Finally, we derive and validate a scaling
law for catastrophic forgetting, revealing that AGL flattens post-finetuning
loss escalation while preserving adaptation dynamics. AGL is a structurally
grounded refinement of LoRA, ensuring alignment preservation with minimal
trade-offs. To encourage further exploration and development, we open-source
our implementation.</p>

to condition their own contributions. By redesigning the public-goods reward,
effortful contributions become the unique Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium
(SPNE), which eliminates free-riding under traditional SPGG or PGG. Its
sequential protocol replaces costly round-based information exchanges with a
streamlined decision flow, cutting <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" /></a> overhead while retaining
strategic depth. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the SPNE under
realistic parameters, and empirically show that MAC-SPGG-trained ensembles
outperform single-agent baselines, chain-of-thought prompting, and other
cooperative methods, even achieving comparable performance to large-scale
models across reasoning, math, code generation, and NLP tasks. Our results

PunGPT2 captures rich syntactic and morphological features unique to Punjabi

we introduce Pun-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework combining
PunGPT2 with a dense FAISS retriever over a curated Punjabi knowledge base. We

unprecedented demands for low latency on cloud GPUs, forcing them into
high-power modes and causing escalating energy costs. Real-time inference

compromising peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose AGFT (An
Adaptive GPU Frequency Tuner), a framework that employs online reinforcement

monitoring real-time features like request load and latency, AGFT utilizes
fine-grained frequency control for precise adjustments and intelligent action

environment simulating realistic, fluctuating inference requests. The
experimental results demonstrate that AGFT successfully saves 44.3% of GPU

structured clinical consultation templates for electronic consultation. Using
145 expert-crafted templates developed and routinely used by Stanford's
eConsult team, we assess frontier models -- including o3, GPT-4o, Kimi K2,
Claude 4 Sonnet, Llama 3 70B, and Gemini 2.5 Pro -- for their ability to
produce clinically coherent, concise, and prioritized clinical question
schemas. Through a multi-agent pipeline combining prompt optimization, semantic
autograding, and prioritization analysis, we show that while models like o3
achieve high comprehensiveness (up to 92.2\%), they consistently generate
excessively long templates and fail to correctly prioritize the most clinically
important questions under length constraints. Performance varies across
specialties, with significant degradation in narrative-driven fields such as
psychiatry and pain medicine. Our findings demonstrate that <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s can enhance

<p>Textual reviews enrich recommender systems with fine-grained preference
signals and enhanced explainability. However, in real-world scenarios, users
rarely leave reviews, resulting in severe <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" /></a> that undermines the
effectiveness of existing models. A natural solution is to impute or generate
missing reviews to enrich the data. However, conventional imputation techniques
-- such as matrix completion and <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>-based augmentation -- either lose
contextualized semantics by embedding texts into vectors, or overlook
structural dependencies among user-item interactions. To address these
shortcomings, we propose TWISTER (ToWards Imputation on Sparsity with Textual
Edge Graph Representation), a unified framework that imputes missing reviews by
jointly modeling semantic and structural signals. Specifically, we represent
user-item interactions as a Textual-Edge Graph (TEG), treating reviews as edge
attributes. To capture relational context, we construct line-graph views and
employ a large language model as a graph-aware aggregator. For each interaction
lacking a textual review, our model aggregates the neighborhood's
natural-language representations to generate a coherent and personalized
review. Experiments on the Amazon and Goodreads datasets show that TWISTER
consistently outperforms traditional numeric, graph-based, and <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> baselines,
delivering higher-quality imputed reviews and, more importantly, enhanced
recommendation performance. In summary, TWISTER generates reviews that are more
helpful, authentic, and specific, while smoothing structural signals for
improved recommendations.</p>

frameworks suffer from limited generalization, shallow contextual reasoning,
and reliance on mono-modal inputs. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer enhanced
reasoning and multimodal integration but typically fall short of real-time
performance requirements in safety-critical applications. This paper presents
REACT, a real-time, V2X-integrated trajectory optimization framework built upon
a fine-tuned lightweight VLM. REACT integrates a set of specialized modules
that process multimodal inputs into optimized, risk-aware trajectories. To
ensure real-time performance on edge devices, REACT incorporates edge
adaptation strategies that reduce model complexity and accelerate inference.
Evaluated on the DeepAccident benchmark, REACT achieves state-of-the-art
performance, a 77% collision rate reduction, a 48.2% Video Panoptic Quality
(VPQ), and a 0.57-second inference latency on the Jetson AGX Orin. Ablation
studies validate the contribution of each input, module, and edge adaptation
strategy. These results demonstrate the feasibility of lightweight VLMs for
real-time edge-based cooperative planning and showcase the potential of
language-guided contextual reasoning to improve safety and responsiveness in
autonomous driving.</p>

<p>Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the next item for an

to the short and anonymous nature of sessions. Recently, an emerging line of
work has explored inferring the underlying user intents of a session using
large language models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s), with the generated intents serving as auxiliary
training signals to enhance SBR models. Despite its promise, this approach
faces three key challenges: validating intent quality, incorporating
session-level multi-intents, and complementing inevitable <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> failure cases. In

<p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in graph-based
learning by propagating information among neighbor nodes via predefined
aggregation mechanisms. However, such fixed schemes often suffer from two key
limitations. First, they cannot handle the imbalance in node informativeness --
some nodes are rich in information, while others remain <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a>. Second,
predefined message passing primarily leverages local structural similarity
while ignoring global semantic relationships across the graph, limiting the
model's ability to capture distant but relevant information. We propose
Retrieval-augmented Graph Agentic Network (ReaGAN), an agent-based framework
that empowers each node with autonomous, node-level decision-making. Each node
acts as an agent that independently plans its next action based on its internal
memory, enabling node-level planning and adaptive message propagation.
Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows nodes to access
semantically relevant content and build global relationships in the graph.
ReaGAN achieves competitive performance under few-shot in-context settings
using a frozen <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> backbone without fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of

efficiency, they often fail to reduce time to first token (TTFT) and may
degrade performance through token <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080" /></a>. Alternative sequence modeling
architectures address some of these limitations, but typically require full
retraining and lack infrastructure support. EdgeInfinite offers an efficient
solution by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, maintaining quality
while reducing both computational and memory costs, including improved TTFT.
However, its instruction-following ability is limited, and it lacks
mobile-specific optimizations. To address these issues, we propose
EdgeInfinite-Instruct, which introduces a Segmented Supervised Fine-Tuning
(S-SFT) strategy tailored to long-sequence tasks such as summarization and
question answering. We further optimized EdgeInfinite-Instruct for efficient
deployment on edge NPUs by employing fine-grained post-training quantization
(PTQ) to reduce computational demands while maintaining accuracy, and by
implementing a fixed-shape computation graph that balances memory usage and
on-device efficiency through scenario-specific customization of input token and
cache sizes. Experiments on long-context benchmarks and real-world mobile tasks
show that our approach improves domain-specific performance while maintaining
efficiency on NPU-accelerated edge devices.</p>

systematically evaluate combinations of these techniques to assess how this
