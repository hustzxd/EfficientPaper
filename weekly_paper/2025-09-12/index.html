<p>Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting
deployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower
numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080" /></a> suffers from catastrophic
performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as
QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before
<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080" /></a>, using computational invariance: <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Wx} =
(\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\mathbf{Qx})</script> for orthogonal <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{Q}</script>. However, these
methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case
coherence <script type="math/tex">\mu = 1/\sqrt{n}</script>--that cannot adapt to specific weight
distributions. We identify that different <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a> layers exhibit distinct
outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than
one-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces
Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by
continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete <script type="math/tex">\{+1, -1\}</script>
entries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning,
butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization
while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint
ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving <script type="math/tex">O(n \log
n)</script> computational complexity with only <script type="math/tex">\frac{n \log n}{2}</script> learnable
parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on
post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to

Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in
minutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit

<p>Neural Audio Codecs (NACs) have become increasingly adopted in speech
processing tasks due to their excellent rate-distortion performance and
compatibility with Large Language Models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s) as discrete feature
representations for audio generation. While most existing codecs rely on
Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ), Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) has
recently emerged as a compelling alternative that simplifies training and
natively supports single codebooks. We introduce NeuCodec, an FSQ-based NAC,
and show that FSQ encodes baked-in redundancy which produces an encoding which
is robust when transmitted through noisy channels. First, through an encoder
distillation experiment, we show that two different encoders can learn to
encode identical audio into vastly different code sequences whilst maintaining
comparable reconstruction quality with the same <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantize-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantize-F08080" /></a>r and <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>r. Second,
we demonstrate that FSQ has vastly superior bit-level perturbation robustness
by comparing the performance of RVQ and FSQ codecs when simulating the
transmission of code sequences through a noisy channel.</p>

<p>Serverless computing provides dynamic scalability, but its infrastructure
overhead becomes a bottleneck for emerging workloads such as <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> agents, which
exhibit unpredictable invocation patterns and variable resource demands. Our
analysis shows that for these agents, the cost of running on serverless
platforms can reach up to 70% of the cost of <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> API calls. This finding
motivates the need for a more efficient, high-density serverless platform. We
present TrEnv, a co-designed serverless platform that supports both container-
and VM-based environments, optimized for the unique demands of <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> agents.
TrEnv reduces startup latency and memory usage through repurposable sandboxes
and memory templates, which enable fast reuse and restoration of execution
environments. To further reduce overhead in VM-based agent workloads, TrEnv
leverages browser sharing and a page <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/cache-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/cache-F08080" /></a> bypassing mechanism. Evaluations
show that TrEnv reduces P99 latency by up to 7X and memory usage by 48% in
container-based settings, and achieves up to 58% lower P99 latency and 61%
memory savings for VM-based agents compared to state-of-the-art systems like
E2B.</p>

inference -- they often have much larger context lengths to capture complex,
prolonged inputs, such as entire webpage DOMs or complicated tool call
trajectories. This, in turn, generates significant off-chip memory traffic for
the underlying hardware at the inference stage and causes the workload to be
constrained by two memory walls, namely the bandwidth and capacity memory
walls, preventing the on-chip compute units from achieving high utilization.
  In this paper, we introduce PLENA, a hardware-software co-designed system
that applies three core optimization pathways to tackle these challenges. PLENA
includes an efficient hardware implementation of compute and memory units

Additionally, PLENA is developed with a complete
stack, including a custom ISA, a compiler, a cycle-emulated simulator, and an
automated design space exploration flow. The simulated results show that PLENA
achieves up to 8.5x higher utilization than existing accelerators, and delivers
2.24x higher throughput than the A100 GPU and 3.85x higher throughput than the

<p>This paper investigates automatic piano transcription based on
computationally-efficient yet high-performant variants of the Transformer that
can capture longer-term dependency over the whole musical piece. Recently,
<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a>-based sequence-to-sequence models have demonstrated excellent
performance in piano transcription. These models, however, fail to deal with
the whole piece at once due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention
mechanism, and music signals are thus typically processed in a sliding-window
manner in practice. To overcome this limitation, we propose an efficient
architecture with <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> attention mechanisms. Specifically, we introduce
sliding-window self-attention mechanisms for both the encoder and <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>r, and
a hybrid global-local cross-attention mechanism that attends to various spans
according to the MIDI token types. We also use a hierarchical pooling strategy

inference speed, while maintaining transcription performance comparable to the

<p>Classifying patents by their relevance to the UN Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) is crucial for tracking how innovation addresses global
challenges. However, the absence of a large, labeled dataset limits the use of
supervised learning. Existing methods, such as keyword searches, transfer
learning, and citation-based heuristics, lack scalability and generalizability.
This paper frames patent-to-SDG classification as a weak supervision problem,
using citations from patents to SDG-tagged scientific publications (NPL
citations) as a noisy initial signal. To address its <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" /></a> and noise, we
develop a composite labeling function (LF) that uses large language models
(<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s) to extract structured concepts, namely functions, solutions, and
applications, from patents and SDG papers based on a patent ontology.
Cross-domain similarity scores are computed and combined using a rank-based
retrieval approach. The LF is calibrated via a custom positive-only loss that
aligns with known NPL-SDG links without penalizing discovery of new SDG
associations. The result is a silver-standard, soft multi-label dataset mapping
patents to SDGs, enabling the training of effective multi-label regression
models. We validate our approach through two complementary strategies: (1)
internal validation against held-out NPL-based labels, where our method
outperforms several baselines including <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a>-based models, and zero-shot

co-inventor, and co-applicant graphs, where our labels reveal greater thematic,
cognitive, and organizational coherence than traditional technological
classifications. These results show that weak supervision and semantic
alignment can enhance SDG classification at scale.</p>

difficult to assign credit to intermediate steps. Previous methods mainly focus
on creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional
reinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by
using Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we
identify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s: the magnitude
of policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to
inefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially
destabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose
Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the
learning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG
amplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors,
and attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. We
further introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to
find more predictable solution paths. Through comprehensive experiments on
three challenging agent tasks, WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search, we
demonstrate that EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly
outperforms strong policy gradient baselines. Project page is at

<p>In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical
image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks
without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain
limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve
high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no
unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation
and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL
in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a
universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering
diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement
across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse
employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that
progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent,
full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical
awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that
facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while

Medverse is
extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering
previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.
Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL
baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and

for robust inference across noisy wireless channels. However, their substantial
computational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in
resource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free
framework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a>s to
jointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the
selection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization
problem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian
process-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal
configurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application
requirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant
reductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy
across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional
results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging
aggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism
to trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish

<p>CPU-based trusted execution environments (TEEs) and differential privacy (DP)
have gained wide applications for private inference. Due to high inference
latency in TEEs, researchers use partition-based approaches that offload linear
model components to GPUs. However, dense nonlinear layers of large language
models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s) result in significant <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" /></a> overhead between TEEs and
GPUs. DP-based approaches apply random noise to protect data privacy, but this
compromises <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> performance and semantic understanding. To overcome the above
drawbacks, this paper proposes CMIF, a Confidential and efficient Model
Inference Framework. CMIF confidentially deploys the embedding layer in the
client-side TEE and subsequent layers on GPU servers. Meanwhile, it optimizes
the Report-Noisy-Max mechanism to protect sensitive inputs with a slight
decrease in model performance. Extensive experiments on Llama-series models
demonstrate that CMIF reduces additional inference overhead in TEEs while

<p>The cold-start user issue further compromises the effectiveness of
recommender systems in limiting access to the historical behavioral
information. It is an effective pipeline to optimize instructional prompts on a
few-shot large language model (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>) used in recommender tasks. We introduce a
context-conditioned prompt formulation method P(u,\ Ds)\ \rightarrow\
R\widehat, where u is a cold-start user profile, Ds is a curated support set,
and R\widehat is the predicted ranked list of items. Based on systematic
experimentation with <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a>-based autoregressive <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s (BioGPT, LLaMA-2,
GPT-4), we provide empirical evidence that optimal exemplar injection and
instruction structuring can significantly improve the precision@k and NDCG
scores of such models in low-data settings. The pipeline uses token-level
alignments and embedding space regularization with a greater semantic fidelity.
Our findings not only show that timely composition is not merely syntactic but

that predicts and subsequently embeds an object density map. The embedded
density information is then systematically integrated into the <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>r.
Existing density map definitions typically depend on head positions or
object-based spatial statistics. Our method extends these definitions to
include individual bounding box dimensions. By incorporating density
information into object queries, our method utilizes density-guided queries to
improve detection in crowded scenes. CQ is universally applicable to both 2D
and 3D detection without requiring additional data. Consequently, we are the
first to design a method that effectively bridges 2D and 3D detection in
crowded environments. We demonstrate the integration of CQ into both a general
2D and 3D <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a>-based object detector, introducing the architectures CQ2D

Experiments on the STCrowd dataset for both 2D and 3D domains show significant
performance improvements compared to the base models, outperforming most
state-of-the-art methods. When integrated into a state-of-the-art crowd
detector, CQ can further improve performance on the challenging CrowdHuman

within these candidate regions by generating pseudo-data points, thereby
improving data utilization efficiency and accelerating convergence. Benchmark
evaluations** further confirm that ChemBOMAS significantly enhances
optimization effectiveness and efficiency compared to various BO algorithms.
Importantly, the practical utility of ChemBOMAS was validated through wet-lab
experiments conducted under pharmaceutical industry protocols, targeting
conditional optimization for a previously unreported and challenging chemical
reaction. In the wet experiment, ChemBOMAS achieved an optimal objective value
of 96%. This was substantially higher than the 15% achieved by domain experts.
This real-world success, together with strong performance on benchmark

generate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM
optimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical
investigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and
Regularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) -
(1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic
fusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve
information capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which
utilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision
in our proposed Information Tinker. Notably, as a flexible architecture, MoT
adheres to the scaling laws of GFM, offering a controllable model scale.
Compared to SOTA baselines, experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains
demonstrate that MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised, few-shot,
and zero-shot scenarios.</p>

auto-regressive motion generation tasks. Furthermore, we also show that our

<p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising architecture for modern
large language models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s). However, massive parameters impose heavy GPU

Offloading the expert parameters to CPU RAM offers an effective way to
alleviate the VRAM requirements for MoE inference. Existing approaches

latency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system
with a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically
divided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/cache-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/cache-F08080" /></a>s the top segment of hot
experts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget,
thereby improving the <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/cache-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/cache-F08080" /></a> hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic
predicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top
segments of <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/cache-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/cache-F08080" /></a>d experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is
reduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" /></a>. Nevertheless, the

divide-and-conquer algorithm based on fixed-point iteration for adaptive <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/cache-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/cache-F08080" /></a>

<p>Understanding how information is shared across documents, regardless of the
format in which it is expressed, is critical for tasks such as information
retrieval, summarization, and content alignment. In this work, we introduce a
novel framework for modelling Semantic Coverage Relations (SCR), which
classifies document pairs based on how their informational content aligns. We
define three core relation types: equivalence, where both texts convey the same
information using different textual forms or styles; inclusion, where one
document fully contains the information of another and adds more; and semantic
<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" /></a>, where each document presents partially <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" /></a>ping content. To capture
these relations, we adopt a question answering (QA)-based approach, using the
answerability of shared questions across documents as an indicator of semantic
coverage. We construct a synthetic dataset derived from the SQuAD corpus by
paraphrasing source passages and selectively omitting information, enabling
precise control over content <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" /></a>. This dataset allows us to benchmark

prediction. Our findings demonstrate that discriminative models significantly
outperform generative approaches, with the RoBERTa-base model achieving the
highest accuracy of 61.4% and the Random Forest-based model showing the best
balance with a macro-F1 score of 52.9%. The results show that QA provides an
effective lens for assessing semantic relations across stylistically diverse
texts, offering insights into the capacity of current models to reason about
information beyond surface similarity. The dataset and code developed in this
study are publicly available to support reproducibility.</p>

Resonant Transformer Router (RTR), which achieves frequency separation while
ensuring perfect phase alignment between low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency
(HF) channels at the crossover frequency. The core property of RTR is that its
frequency responses satisfy a linear complementary relation HLF(f)+HHF(f)=1. so
that the original signal can be perfectly reconstructed by linear summation of
the two channels. Theoretical derivation and circuit simulations demonstrate
that RTR provides superior energy efficiency, phase consistency, and robustness

balance CF and downstream task performance. Our investigation reveals that the
degree to which task vectors (i.e., the subtraction of pre-trained weights from

parameters is a critical factor for CF. Based on this finding, FAPM employs the
ratio of the task vector to pre-trained model parameters as a metric to
quantify CF, integrating this measure into the <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080" /></a> criteria. Importantly,
FAPM does not necessitate modifications to the training process or model
architecture, nor does it require any auxiliary data. We conducted extensive
experiments across eight datasets, covering natural language inference, General
Q&amp;A, Medical Q&amp;A, Math Q&amp;A, reading comprehension, and cloze tests. The results
demonstrate that FAPM limits CF to just 0.25\% while maintaining 99.67\%

their text-based pre-training. To mitigate this, the ``adapter + <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>" paradigm
has emerged, where an adapter is designed to bridge the domain gap between the
channel state information (CSI) data and <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s. While showing initial success,
existing adapters may not fully exploit the potential of this paradigm. To
address this limitation, this work provides a key insight that learning
representations from the spectral components of CSI features can more
effectively help bridge the domain gap. Accordingly, we propose a

<p>One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature
of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains,
this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a

a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past

image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose
features are in proximity to that feature. Our <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>r is implemented as a
guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a
pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the
feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature.

protagonist is described as a girl (as compared to a boy), appearance-related
attributes increase by 55.26%. Stories featuring non-Western children
disproportionately emphasize cultural heritage, tradition, and family themes

sociocultural bias in making creative AI use more equitable and diverse.</p>

This raises the question: do human annotators show similar sensitivity to

<p>Modern information retrieval (IR) must bridge short, ambiguous queries and
ever more diverse, rapidly evolving corpora. Query Expansion (QE) remains a key
mechanism for mitigating vocabulary mismatch, but the design space has shifted
markedly with pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large language models
(<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s). This survey synthesizes the field from three angles: (i) a
four-dimensional framework of query expansion - from the point of injection
(explicit vs. implicit QE), through grounding and interaction (knowledge bases,
model-internal capabilities, multi-turn retrieval) and learning alignment, to
knowledge graph-based argumentation; (ii) a model-centric taxonomy spanning
encoder-only, encoder-<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>r, <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>r-only, instruction-tuned, and
domain/multilingual variants, highlighting their characteristic affordances for
QE (contextual disambiguation, controllable generation, zero-/few-shot
reasoning); and (iii) practice-oriented guidance on where and how neural QE
helps in first-stage retrieval, multi-query fusion, re-ranking, and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We compare traditional query expansion
with PLM/<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>-based methods across seven key aspects, and we map applications
across web search, biomedicine, e-commerce, open-domain QA/RAG, conversational
and code search, and cross-lingual settings. The review distills design
grounding and interaction, alignment/distillation (SFT/PEFT/DPO), and KG
constraints - as robust remedies to topic drift and hallucination. We conclude
with an agenda on quality control, cost-aware invocation, domain/temporal
adaptation, evaluation beyond end-task metrics, and fairness/privacy.
Collectively, these insights provide a principled blueprint for selecting and
combining QE techniques under real-world constraints.</p>

diverse tasks, yet their susceptibility to generating incorrect content during

offer potential solutions, their effectiveness is hindered by two inherent
limitations: (1) the absence of reliable guidance signals for error
localization, and (2) the restricted reasoning depth imposed by conventional

<p>We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a
single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN
inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the
Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass.
This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate
the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic
dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data.
For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian
head generation pipeline, where <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> points from the FLAME model interact

shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity
reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D
GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that
effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and
unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head
reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework
towards existing work.</p>

<p>Software vulnerabilities pose serious risks to modern software ecosystems.
While the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is the authoritative source for
cataloging these vulnerabilities, it often lacks explicit links to the
corresponding Vulnerability-Fixing Commits (VFCs). VFCs encode precise code
changes, enabling vulnerability localization, patch analysis, and dataset
construction. Automatically mapping NVD records to their true VFCs is therefore
critical. Existing approaches have limitations as they rely on <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a>, often
noisy commit messages and fail to capture the deep semantics in the

between vulnerability descriptions and their VFCs. PatchSeeker generates
embeddings from NVD descriptions and enhances commit messages by synthesizing
detailed summaries for those that are short or uninformative. These generated
messages act as a semantic bridge, effectively closing the information gap
between natural language reports and low-level code changes. Our approach
PatchSeeker achieves 59.3% higher MRR and 27.9% higher Recall@10 than the
best-performing baseline, Prospector, on the benchmark dataset. The extended
evaluation on recent CVEs further confirms PatchSeeker's effectiveness.
Ablation study shows that both the commit message generation method and the
selection of backbone <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s make a positive contribution to PatchSeeker. We also
discuss limitations and open challenges to guide future work.</p>

We introduce Falcon3-Audio, a family of Audio-Language Models
(ALMs) built on instruction-tuned <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s and Whisper encoders. Using a remarkably
small amount of public audio data -- less than 30K hours (5K unique) --
Falcon3-Audio-7B matches the best reported performance among open-weight models
on the MMAU benchmark, with a score of 64.14, matching R1-AQA, while
distinguishing itself through superior data and parameter efficiency,
single-stage training, and transparency. Notably, our smallest 1B model remains
competitive with larger open models ranging from 2B to 13B parameters. Through
extensive ablations, we find that common complexities -- such as curriculum
learning, multiple audio encoders, and intricate cross-attention connectors --
are not required for strong performance, even compared to models trained on
over 500K hours of data.</p>

<p>Recent advances in large language models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s) have shown impressive
performance in passage reranking tasks. Despite their success, <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>-based
methods still face challenges in efficiency and sensitivity to external biases.
(1) Existing models rely mostly on autoregressive generation and sliding window
strategies to rank passages, which incur heavy computational overhead as the
number of passages increases. (2) External biases, such as position or
selection bias, hinder the model's ability to accurately represent passages and
increase input-order sensitivity. To address these limitations, we introduce a
novel passage reranking model, called Multi-View-guided Passage Reranking
(MVP). MVP is a non-generative <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>-based reranking method that encodes
query-passage information into diverse view embeddings without being influenced
by external biases. For each view, it combines query-aware passage embeddings
to produce a distinct anchor vector, which is then used to directly compute
relevance scores in a single <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080" /></a> step. In addition, it employs an
orthogonal loss to make the views more distinctive. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MVP, with just 220M parameters, matches the performance of
much larger 7B-scale fine-tuned models while achieving a 100x reduction in
inference latency. Notably, the 3B-parameter variant of MVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

<p>Large Language Models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s) have demonstrated impressive performance across
a wide range of deep learning tasks. Mixture of Experts (MoE) further enhances
their capabilities by increasing model width through <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a>ly activated expert
branches, which keeps inference computation efficient. However, the large
number of expert weights introduces significant GPU memory pressure, especially
in resource-constrained environments such as single-GPU servers. More
importantly, MoE inference consists of two fundamentally different stages: a
<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/prefill-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/prefill-F08080" /></a> stage where most experts are activated densely, and a <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a> stage
where only a few experts are triggered <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a>ly. Treating these stages with a
uniform scheduling strategy often leads to suboptimal latency and memory usage.
To address this, we propose DuoServe-MoE, an inference <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00" /></a> system that

scheduling strategies to each. In the <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/prefill-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/prefill-F08080" /></a> stage, DuoServe-MoE uses a
two-stream CUDA pipeline that <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" /></a>s expert weight prefetching with the
computation of non-MoE layers, limiting expert residency in GPU memory. In the
<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a> stage, a lightweight layer-level predictor trained offline from
activation traces is used to prefetch only the most likely activated experts,
without requiring any changes to the model. Experiments on 4-bit Mixtral-8x7B
and 8x22B models show that DuoServe-MoE improves end-to-end latency by 1.42 to
7.54 times while keeping peak memory usage at only 15 percent of the full model
size.</p>

contexts. In this work, we introduce PersonaFuse, a novel <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> post-training

varying situations. Inspired by Trait Activation Theory and the Big Five
personality model, PersonaFuse employs a Mixture-of-Expert architecture that
combines persona adapters with a dynamic routing network, enabling contextual
trait expression. Experimental results show that PersonaFuse substantially
outperforms baseline models across multiple dimensions of social-emotional
intelligence. Importantly, these gains are achieved without sacrificing general
reasoning ability or model safety, which remain common limitations of direct
prompting and supervised fine-tuning approaches. PersonaFuse also delivers
consistent improvements in downstream human-centered applications, such as
mental health counseling and review-based customer service. Finally, human
preference evaluations against leading <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek,
demonstrate that PersonaFuse achieves competitive response quality despite its
comparatively smaller model size. These findings demonstrate that PersonaFuse
offers a theoretically grounded and practical approach for developing
