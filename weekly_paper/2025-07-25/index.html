concepts. Investigating the topological structures of <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> embedding spaces via
mapper graphs enables us to understand their underlying structures.
Specifically, a mapper graph summarizes the topological structure of the
embedding space, where each node represents a topological neighborhood
(containing a cluster of embeddings), and an edge connects two nodes if their
corresponding neighborhoods <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" /></a>. However, manually exploring these
embedding spaces to uncover encoded linguistic properties requires considerable
human effort. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework for
semi-automatic annotation of these embedding properties. To organize the
exploration process, we first define a taxonomy of explorable elements within a
mapper graph such as nodes, edges, paths, components, and trajectories. The
annotation of these elements is executed through two types of customizable
<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>-based agents that employ perturbation techniques for scalable and automated
analysis. These agents help to explore and explain the characteristics of
mapper elements and verify the robustness of the generated explanations. We
instantiate the framework within a visual analytics workspace and demonstrate
its effectiveness through case studies. In particular, we replicate findings
from prior research on BERT's embedding properties across various layers of its
architecture and provide further observations into the linguistic properties of
topological neighborhoods.</p>

all pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in
datasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To
address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a
novel method that explicitly integrates <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> dependency graphs into <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s'
attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module
guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key
feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing

competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality.
Our method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution

<p>In this paper, we consider the fair access problem and the Age of Information
(AoI) under 5G New Radio (NR) Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Mode 2 in
vehicular networks. Specifically, vehicles follow Mode 2 to communicate with
Roadside Units (RSUs) to obtain accurate data for driving
assistance.Nevertheless, vehicles often have different velocity when they are
moving in adjacent lanes, leading to difference in RSU dwelltime and
<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" /></a> duration. This results in unfair access to network resources,
potentially influencing driving safety. To ensure the freshness of received
data, the AoI should be analyzed. Mode 2 introduces a novel preemption
mechanism, necessitating simultaneous optimization of fair access and AoI to
guarantee timely and relevant data delivery. We propose a joint optimization
framework for vehicular network, defining a fairness index and employing
Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHS) to model AoI under preemption mechanism. By
adaptively adjusting the selection window of Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS)
in Mode 2, we address the optimization of fairness and AoI. We apply a large
language model (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>)-Based Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on
Decomposition (MOEA/D) to solve this problem. Simulation results demonstrate
the effectiveness of our scheme in balancing fair access and minimizing AoI.</p>

as a powerful solution for dealing with complex problems across diverse
domains. The effectiveness of MAS is critically dependent on its collaboration
topology, which has become a focal point for automated design research.
However, existing approaches are fundamentally constrained by their reliance on
a template graph modification paradigm with a predefined set of agents and
hard-coded interaction structures, significantly limiting their adaptability to
task-specific requirements. To address these limitations, we reframe MAS design
as a conditional autoregressive graph generation task, where both the system
composition and structure are designed jointly. We propose ARG-Designer, a
novel autoregressive model that operationalizes this paradigm by constructing
the collaboration graph from scratch. Conditioned on a natural language task
query, ARG-Designer sequentially and dynamically determines the required number
of agents, selects their appropriate roles from an extensible pool, and
establishes the optimal <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" /></a> links between them. This generative
approach creates a customized topology in a flexible and extensible manner,
precisely tailored to the unique demands of different tasks. Extensive
experiments across six diverse benchmarks demonstrate that ARG-Designer not
only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also enjoys significantly
greater token efficiency and enhanced extensibility. The source code of

mitigate such gaps in a training-free manner. Specifically, we first estimate
the magnitude gap caused by layer removal and then eliminate this gap by
rescaling the remaining weights offline, with zero runtime overhead incurred.
We further demonstrate the advantages of Prune&amp;Comp through an iterative

challenges the real-time ASR requirements. Although speculative decoding has
been explored for better decoding efficiency, they usually ignore the key
characteristics of the ASR task and achieve limited speedup. To further reduce
the real-time ASR latency, in this paper, we propose a novel speculative
decoding framework specialized for ASR, dubbed SpecASR. SpecASR is developed
based on our core observation that ASR decoding is audio-conditioned, which
results in high output alignment between small and large ASR models, even given
output mismatches in intermediate decoding steps. Therefore, SpecASR features
an adaptive draft sequence generation process that dynamically modifies the
draft sequence length to maximize the token acceptance length. SpecASR further
proposes a draft sequence recycling strategy that reuses the previously
generated draft sequence to reduce the draft ASR model latency. Moreover, a
two-pass <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> token tree generation algorithm is also proposed to balance the
latency of draft and target ASR models. With extensive experimental results, we
demonstrate SpecASR achieves 3.04x-3.79x and 1.25x-1.84x speedup over the
baseline autoregressive decoding and speculative decoding, respectively,
without any loss in recognition accuracy.</p>

massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) and millimeter-wave (mmWave),
introduces significant network complexity and computational demands.
Significant research efforts have been made to improve physical layer
performance by resorting to deep learning (DL) methods, which, however, are
usually task-specific and struggle with data scarcity and generalization. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel In-Context Wireless Large Model
(ICWLM), a wireless-native foundation model designed for simultaneous
multi-task learning at the physical layer. Unlike conventional methods that
adapt wireless data to pre-trained large language models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s), ICWLM is
trained directly on large-scale, mixed wireless datasets from scratch. It
jointly solves multiple classical physical layer problems, including multi-user
precoding (sum-rate maximization and max-min SINR) and channel prediction. A
key innovation of ICWLM is its utilization of in-context learning (ICL),
enabling the model to adapt to varying system configurations and channel
conditions with minimal demonstration pairs, eliminating the need for extensive
retraining. Furthermore, we employ the Dynamic Weight Averaging (DWA) algorithm
to dynamically balance the individual task losses during multi-task training,
ensuring efficient and stable learning across diverse objectives. Extensive
simulation results demonstrate that ICWLM achieves competitive performance
compared to task-specific methods while exhibiting remarkable generalization
capabilities to unseen system configurations. This work offers a promising
paradigm for developing unified and adaptive AI models for future wireless
networks, potentially reducing deployment complexity and enhancing intelligent
resource management.</p>

million tweets posted by parliamentarians in 19 European countries between 2017
and 2022. The results reveal consistent cross-national patterns: governing

<p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of

due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences.
Existing <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/acceleration-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/acceleration-F08080" /></a> strategies either reduce sequence length through early
stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via
speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers
from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low,
and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing
concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a
token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT
inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large
language model (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to

and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible
with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency
with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in
accelerating CoT reasoning.</p>

language models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s) with complex tasks and human preferences. While it is
often assumed that RL fine-tuning requires updating most of a model's
parameters, we challenge this assumption with a surprising finding: RL
fine-tuning consistently modifies only a small subnetwork (typically 5-30% of
weights), leaving most parameters unchanged. We call this phenomenon RL-induced
parameter update <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" /></a>. It arises naturally, without any <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" /></a>
constraints or parameter-efficient tuning, and appears across multiple RL
algorithms (e.g., PPO, DPO, SimPO, PRIME) and model families (e.g., OpenAI,
Meta, and open-source <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s). Moreover, the subnetworks updated by RL show
substantial <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" /></a> across different seeds, datasets, and algorithms-far
exceeding chance-suggesting a partially transferable structure in the
pretrained model. We show that fine-tuning only this <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> subnetwork recovers
full model performance and yields parameters nearly identical to the fully
fine-tuned model. Our analysis suggests this <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" /></a> emerges because RL
operates near the model's original distribution, requiring only targeted
changes. KL penalties, gradient clipping, and on-policy dynamics have limited
effect on the <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" /></a> pattern. These findings shed new light on how RL adapts
models: not by shifting all weights, but by focusing training on a small,
consistently updated subnetwork. This insight enables more efficient RL methods

post-training phase. However, safety alignment fine-tuning has recently been
shown to significantly degrade reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as the
"Safety Tax". In this work, we show that using LoRA for SFT on refusal datasets
effectively aligns the model for safety without harming its reasoning
capabilities. This is because restricting the safety weight updates to a
low-rank space minimizes the interference with the reasoning weights. Our
extensive experiments across four benchmarks covering math, science, and coding
show that this approach produces highly safe <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s -- with safety levels

<p>Code translation is a crucial process in software development and migration
projects, enabling interoperability between different programming languages and
enhancing software adaptability and thus longevity. Traditional automated
translation methods rely heavily on handcrafted transformation rules, which
often lack flexibility and scalability. Meanwhile, advanced language models
present promising alternatives but are often limited by proprietary, API-based
implementations that raise concerns over data security and reliance. In this
paper, we present Auto-Train for Code Translation (ACT), an innovative
framework that aims to improve code translation capabilities by enabling
in-house finetuning of open-source Large Language Models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s). ACT's
automated pipeline significantly boosts the performance of these models,
narrowing the gap between open-source accessibility and the high performance of
closed-source solutions. Central to ACT is its synthetic data generation
module, which builds extensive, high-quality datasets from initial code
samples, incorporating unit tests to ensure functional accuracy and diversity.
ACT's evaluation framework incorporates execution-level checks, offering a
comprehensive assessment of translation quality. A key feature in ACT is its
controller module, which manages the entire pipeline by dynamically adjusting
hyperparameters, orchestrating iterative data generation, and finetuning based
on real-time evaluations. This enables ACT to intelligently optimize when to
continue training, generate additional targeted training data, or stop the
process. Our results demonstrate that ACT consistently enhances the
effectiveness of open-source models, offering businesses and developers a
secure and reliable alternative. Additionally, applying our data generation
pipeline to industry-scale migration projects has led to a notable increase in

<p>This work tackles the problem of Online detection of Take and Release (OTR)
of an object in untrimmed egocentric videos. This task is challenging due to
severe label imbalance, with temporally <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> positive annotations, and the
need for precise temporal predictions. Furthermore, methods need to be
computationally efficient in order to be deployed in real-world online
settings. To address these challenges, we propose Mamba-OTR, a model based on
the Mamba architecture. Mamba-OTR is designed to exploit temporal recurrence
during inference while being trained on short video clips. To address label
imbalance, our training pipeline incorporates the focal loss and a novel
regularization scheme that aligns model predictions with the evaluation metric.
Extensive experiments on EPIC-KITCHENS-100, the comparisons with
<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a>-based approach, and the evaluation of different training and test
schemes demonstrate the superiority of Mamba-OTR in both accuracy and
efficiency. These finding are particularly evident when evaluating full-length
videos or high frame-rate sequences, even when trained on short video snippets
for computational convenience. The proposed Mamba-OTR achieves a noteworthy
mp-mAP of 45.48 when operating in a sliding-window fashion, and 43.35 in
streaming mode, versus the 20.32 of a vanilla <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a> and 25.16 of a

<p>Model compression is crucial for minimizing memory storage and accelerating
inference in deep learning (DL) models, including recent foundation models like

versions according to their resources and budget. However, while existing
compression operations primarily focus on optimizing the trade-off between
resource efficiency and model performance, the privacy risks introduced by
compression remain overlooked and insufficiently understood.
  In this work, through the lens of membership inference attack (MIA), we
propose CompLeak, the first privacy risk evaluation framework examining three
widely used compression configurations that are <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080" /></a>, quantization, and
weight clustering supported by the commercial model compression framework of
Google's TensorFlow-Lite (TF-Lite) and Facebook's PyTorch Mobile. CompLeak has
three variants, given available access to the number of compressed models and
original model. CompLeakNR starts by adopting existing MIA methods to attack a
single compressed model, and identifies that different compressed models
influence members and non-members differently. When the original model and one
compressed model are available, CompLeakSR leverages the compressed model as a
reference to the original model and uncovers more privacy by combining meta
information (e.g., confidence vector) from both models. When multiple
compressed models are available with/without accessing the original model,
CompLeakMR innovatively exploits privacy leakage info from multiple compressed
versions to substantially signify the overall privacy leakage. We conduct
extensive experiments on seven diverse model architectures (from ResNet to
foundation models of BERT and GPT-2), and six image and textual benchmark
datasets.</p>

prominent in academia and industry due to their strong performance in the
next-item prediction task. Yet common evaluation protocols for sequential
recommendations remain insufficiently developed: they often fail to reflect the
corresponding recommendation task accurately, or are not aligned with
real-world scenarios.
  Although the widely used leave-one-out split matches next-item prediction, it
permits the <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" /></a> between training and test periods, which leads to temporal
leakage and unrealistically long test horizon, limiting real-world relevance.
Global temporal splitting addresses these issues by evaluating on distinct
future periods. However, its applications to sequential recommendations remain
loosely defined, particularly in terms of selecting target interactions and
constructing a validation subset that provides necessary consistency between
validation and test metrics.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that evaluation outcomes can vary significantly
across splitting strategies, influencing model rankings and practical
deployment decisions. To improve reproducibility in both academic and
industrial settings, we systematically compare different splitting strategies
for sequential recommendations across multiple datasets and established
baselines. Our findings show that prevalent splits, such as leave-one-out, may
be insufficiently aligned with more realistic evaluation strategies. Code:

GPU memory pressure, which is further aggravated by training optimization
techniques such as virtual pipeline and recomputation that disrupt tensor
lifespans and introduce considerable memory fragmentation. Default GPU memory
allocators of popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch use online
strategies without knowledge of tensor lifespans, which can waste up to 43\% of
memory and cause out-of-memory errors, rendering optimization techniques
ineffective or even unusable.
  To address this, we introduce STWeaver, a GPU memory allocator for deep
learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and
temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads.
STWeaver introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online
allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to
generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles
complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a
pluggable PyTorch allocator, STWeaver reduces fragmentation ratio on average by
79.2\% (up to 100\%) across both dense and <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> models, with negligible

<p>Natural language interfaces offer a compelling approach for music
recommendation, enabling users to express complex preferences conversationally.
While Large Language Models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s) show promise in this direction, their
scalability in recommender systems is limited by high costs and latency.
Retrieval-based approaches using smaller language models mitigate these issues
but often rely on single-modal item representations, overlook long-term user
preferences, and require full model retraining, posing challenges for
real-world deployment. In this paper, we present JAM (Just Ask for Music), a
lightweight and intuitive framework for natural language music recommendation.
JAM models user-query-item interactions as vector translations in a shared
latent space, inspired by knowledge graph embedding methods like TransE. To
capture the complexity of music and user intent, JAM aggregates multimodal item
features via cross-attention and <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> mixture-of-experts. We also introduce
JAMSessions, a new dataset of over 100k user-query-item triples with anonymized

<p>The growing integration of renewable energy sources in modern power systems
has introduced significant operational challenges due to their intermittent and
uncertain outputs. In recent years, mobile energy storage systems (ESSs) have
emerged as a popular flexible resource for mitigating these challenges.
Compared to stationary ESSs, mobile ESSs offer additional spatial flexibility,
enabling cost-effective energy delivery through the transportation network.
However, the widespread deployment of mobile ESSs is often hindered by the high
investment cost, which has motivated researchers to investigate utilising more
readily available alternatives, such as electric vehicles (EVs) as mobile
energy storage units instead. Hence, we explore this opportunity with a
MIP-based day-ahead electric vehicle joint routing and scheduling problem in
this work. However, solving the problem in a practical setting can often be
computationally intractable since the existence of binary variables makes it
combinatorial challenging. Therefore, we proposed to simplify the problem's
solution process for a MIP solver by <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080" /></a> the solution search space with a

This is done by training the model
to rapidly predict the optimal binary solutions. In addition, unlike many
existing DL approaches that assume fixed problem structures, the proposed model
is designed to accommodate problems with EV fleets of any sizes. This
flexibility is essential since frequent re-training can introduce significant
computational overhead. We evaluated the approach with simulations on the IEEE
33-bus system coupled with the Nguyen-Dupuis transportation network.</p>

which involves switching to unexpected languages in the model response. This
problem leads to poor readability and degrades the usability of model

appropriate pre-activation values of specific language features during

SASFT consistently reduces unexpected code-switching by more than 50\% compared

the classification accuracy achieved by a pre-trained deep TLM architecture can
be replicated through a soft committee of multiple, independently pre-trained

<p>In intensive care units (ICUs), patients with complex clinical conditions

vital diagnostic tool, providing insights into clinical trajectories, but their
irregular acquisition limits their utility. Existing tools for CXR
interpretation are constrained by cross-sectional analysis, failing to capture
temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce CXR-TFT, a novel multi-modal
framework that integrates temporally <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> CXR imaging and radiology reports
with high-frequency clinical data, such as vital signs, laboratory values, and
respiratory flow sheets, to predict the trajectory of CXR findings in
critically ill patients. CXR-TFT leverages latent embeddings from a vision
encoder that are temporally aligned with hourly clinical data through
interpolation. A <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a> model is then trained to predict CXR embeddings at
each hour, conditioned on previous embeddings and clinical measurements. In a
retrospective study of 20,000 ICU patients, CXR-TFT demonstrated high accuracy
in forecasting abnormal CXR findings up to 12 hours before they became
radiographically evident. This predictive capability in clinical data holds
significant potential for enhancing the management of time-sensitive conditions
like acute respiratory distress syndrome, where early intervention is crucial
and diagnoses are often delayed. By providing distinctive temporal resolution
in prognostic CXR analysis, CXR-TFT offers actionable 'whole patient' insights
that can directly improve clinical outcomes.</p>

Chain-of-thought tokEnization), a novel generative framework for multi-behavior
sequential recommendation. GRACE introduces a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
tokenization method that encodes user-item interactions with explicit
attributes from product knowledge graphs (e.g., category, brand, price) over
semantic tokenization, enabling interpretable and behavior-aligned generation.
To address the inefficiency of standard attention, we design a Journey-Aware
Sparse Attention (JSA) mechanism, which selectively attends to compressed,
intra-, inter-, and current-context segments in the tokenized sequence.
Experiments on two real-world datasets show that GRACE significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to +106.9% HR@10 and

analyzing the challenges that arise in integrating satellite, aerial, and

systematically reviewing five major categories of generative models:
variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs),

memory bandwidth, memory capacity, and synchronization overhead in distributed
inference systems. We develop a hardware-agnostic performance model that
abstracts away implementation details, enabling the analysis of a wide range of
current and near-future hardware technologies. Our analysis spans from current
HBM3 memory technology used in AI accelerators like GPUs and TPUs to systems
based on advanced HBM4 and advanced 3D-stacked DRAM technology. It also covers
SRAM-based designs and scaling techniques from distributed clusters with
varying numbers of chips to wafer-scale integration. Our key findings for
auto-regressive decoding are: i) serving <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s requires 100s of GB per server to

<p>Real-time human-artificial intelligence (AI) collaboration is crucial yet
challenging, especially when AI agents must adapt to diverse and unseen human
behaviors in dynamic scenarios. Existing large language model (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>) agents

address this limitation, we propose a novel dual process multi-scale theory of
mind (DPMT) framework, drawing inspiration from cognitive science dual process
theory. Our DPMT framework incorporates a multi-scale theory of mind (ToM)
module to facilitate robust human partner modeling through mental
characteristic reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that DPMT
significantly enhances human-AI collaboration, and ablation studies further
validate the contributions of our multi-scale ToM in the slow system.</p>

<p>Multi-turn dialogues are essential in many real-world applications of large
language models, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. As conversation
histories become longer, existing large language models face increasing
computational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide
efficient and responsive interactions. Most current <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/acceleration-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/acceleration-F08080" /></a> methods either
compress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on
fixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and
unpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. In this paper,
we present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/acceleration-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/acceleration-F08080" /></a> framework
for large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two
main innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the
prefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the
attention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value
compression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient
cache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a
