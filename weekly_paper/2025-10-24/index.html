an external retriever is used to provide <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s with the most relevant tools for
a query. Existing retrieval models rank tools based on the similarity between a
user query and a tool description (TD). This leads to suboptimal retrieval as
user requests are often poorly aligned with the language of TD. To remedy the
issue, we propose ToolDreamer, a framework to condition retriever models to
fetch tools based on hypothetical (synthetic) TD generated using an <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>, i.e.,

query. The framework enables a more natural alignment between queries and tools
within the language space of TD's. We apply ToolDreamer on the ToolRet dataset
and show that our method improves the performance of <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> and dense

named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which
fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient
magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes,
intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but
minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3
8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or
matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained
via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques,
including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates
catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained
parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other
fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.</p>

<p>A central goal in many brain studies is the identification of those brain
regions that are activated during an observation window that may correspond to
a motor task, a stimulus, or simply a resting state. While functional MRI is
currently the most commonly employed modality for such task, methods based on
the electromagnetic activity of the brain are valuable alternatives because of
their excellent time resolution and of the fact that the measured signals are
directly related to brain activation and not to a secondary effect such as the
hemodynamic response. In this work we focus on the MEG modality, investigating
the performance of a recently proposed Bayesian dictionary learning (BDL)
algorithm for brain region identification. The partitioning of the source space
into the 148 regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to parcellation of the
Destrieux atlas provides a natural determination of the subdictionaries
necessary for the BDL algorithm. We design a simulation protocol where a small
randomly selected patch in each ROI is activated, the MEG signal is computed
and the inverse problem of active brain region identification is solved using
the BDL algorithm. The BDL algorithm consists of two phases, the first one
comprising dictionary <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" /></a> and Bayesian <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" /></a> error analysis, and

they too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of

tasks, including register-transfer level (RTL) hardware synthesis. However,
their tendency to memorize training data poses critical risks when proprietary
or security-sensitive designs are unintentionally exposed during inference.
While prior work has examined memorization in natural language, RTL introduces
unique challenges: In RTL, structurally different implementations (e.g.,
behavioral vs. gate-level descriptions) can realize the same hardware, leading
to intellectual property (IP) leakage (full or partial) even without verbatim

or blocking vs. non-blocking assignments) can drastically alter circuit
behavior, making correctness preservation especially challenging. In this work,
we systematically study memorization in RTL code generation and propose
CircuitGuard, a defense strategy that balances leakage reduction with
correctness preservation. CircuitGuard (1) introduces a novel RTL-aware
similarity metric that captures both structural and functional equivalence
beyond surface-level <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" /></a>, and (2) develops an activation-level steering

for memorization. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that CircuitGuard
identifies (and isolates) 275 memorization-critical features across layers
18-28 of Llama 3.1-8B model, achieving up to 80% reduction in semantic
similarity to proprietary patterns while maintaining generation quality.
CircuitGuard further shows 78-85% cross-domain transfer effectiveness, enabling
robust memorization mitigation across circuit categories without retraining.</p>

this problem, we introduce a novel <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" /></a>-weighted orthogonal (WO)
meta-learner for estimating HTEs that targets regions in the observed data with
high probability of receiving the interventional treatment sequences. This
offers a fully data-driven approach through which our WO-learner can counteract
instabilities as in existing meta-learners and thus obtain more reliable HTE
estimates. Methodologically, we develop a novel Neyman-orthogonal population
risk function that minimizes the <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" /></a>-weighted oracle risk. We show that our
WO-learner has the favorable property of Neyman-orthogonality, meaning that it
is robust against misspecification in the nuisance functions. Further, our
WO-learner is fully model-agnostic and can be applied to any machine learning
model. Through extensive experiments with both <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a> and LSTM backbones,

However, it remains challenging due to limited memory and computational

efficient on-device deployment, ELUTQ provides optimized CPU kernels for
end-to-end inference. Experiments show that for LLaMA3-8B, HLQ reduces
perplexity by about 8% at 3-bit and 85% at 2-bit precision under post-training

systematically tests agent capabilities from single-tool orchestration to
complex cross-server planning, and robustness to out-of-scope requests.
Experiments reveal that rigid hierarchies can hinder performance without

popular paradigm of AI applications. However, trustworthiness issues in MAS
remain a critical concern. Unlike challenges in single-agent systems, MAS
involve more complex <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" /></a> processes, making them susceptible to
corruption attacks. To mitigate this issue, several defense mechanisms have
been developed based on the graph representation of MAS, where agents represent
nodes and <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" /></a>s form edges. Nevertheless, these methods predominantly
focus on static graph defense, attempting to either detect attacks in a fixed
graph structure or optimize a static topology with certain defensive
capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a dynamic defense paradigm
for MAS graph structures, which continuously monitors <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" /></a> within the

<p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, the state-of-the-art in large-scale AI,
achieve high quality by <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a>ly activating parameters. However, their reliance
on routing between a few monolithic experts via a top-k mechanism creates a
"quality cliff", offering only a few coarse-grained operating points. This
inflexibility forces a difficult trade-off between cost and quality, preventing
adaptation to diverse Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and leading to
significant resource over-provisioning.
  This paper introduces MoE-Prism, a model-system co-design that transforms
rigid MoE models into elastic services. Our methodology is divided into two
phases. First, an \emph{Offline Refactoring Engine} systematically deconstructs
monolithic experts into fine-grained "sub-experts." This engine employs a
partitioning optimization solver that uses a metaheuristic-based approach to
group neurons, pre<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00" /></a> functional locality without requiring retraining.
Second, an \emph{Online Scheduling Engine} leverages this new elasticity
through QoS-aware scheduling. It implements specialized policies to solve
complex system problems, including maximizing throughput in cloud deployments
and managing latency-optimized offloading for memory-constrained devices. Our
evaluation across three different MoE models shows that MoE-Prismprovides over
4 times more distinct, stable operating points than the baseline. This allows
an AI service to dynamically improve throughput by up to 19.9\% under a strict
latency budget or reduce latency by up to 10.36\% under limited resources.
MoE-Prism provides the critical "control knob" to bridge the model-system gap,
enabling the next generation of adaptive, efficient, and QoS-aware AI services.</p>

To address this challenge, we propose a framework that dynamically adjusts the
code rate in feature extraction based on its importance to the downstream
inference task by adopting a rate-adaptive <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080" /></a> (RAQ) scheme.
Furthermore, to select the code rate for each edge device under limited
bandwidth constraint, a dynamic programming (DP) approach is leveraged to
allocate the code rate across discrete code rate options. Experiments on
multi-view datasets demonstrate that the proposed frameworks significantly
outperform the frameworks using fixed-rate <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080" /></a>, achieving a favorable

<p>With the goal of improving the security of Internet protocols, we seek
faster, semi-automatic methods to discover new vulnerabilities in protocols
such as DNS, BGP, and others. To this end, we introduce the <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>-Assisted
Protocol Attack Discovery (LAPRAD) methodology, enabling security researchers
with some DNS knowledge to efficiently uncover vulnerabilities that would
otherwise be hard to detect.
  LAPRAD follows a three-stage process. In the first, we consult an <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>
(GPT-o1) that has been trained on a broad corpus of DNS-related sources and
previous DDoS attacks to identify potential exploits. In the second stage, a
different <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> automatically constructs the corresponding attack configurations
using the ReACT approach implemented via LangChain (DNS zone file generation).
Finally, in the third stage, we validate the attack's functionality and
effectiveness.
  Using LAPRAD, we uncovered three new DDoS attacks on the DNS protocol and
rediscovered two recently reported ones that were not included in the <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>'s
training data. The first new attack employs a bait-and-switch technique to
trick resolvers into caching large, bogus DNSSEC RRSIGs, reducing their <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00" /></a>

algorithms (RSA-4096) with multiple keys, thereby bypassing a recently

produce a similar effect.

<p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become essential for unlocking advanced

interleaving rollout and training stages with fundamentally different resource
requirements. Rollout typically dominates overall execution time, yet scales
efficiently through multiple independent instances. In contrast, training
requires tightly-coupled GPUs with full-mesh <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" /></a>. Existing RL
frameworks fall into two categories: co-located and <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/disaggregate-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/disaggregate-F08080" /></a>d
architectures. Co-located ones fail to address this resource tension by forcing
both stages to share the same GPUs. Disaggregated architectures, without
modifications of well-established RL algorithms, suffer from resource
under-utilization. Meanwhile, preemptible GPU resources, i.e., spot instances
on public clouds and spare capacity in production clusters, present significant
cost-saving opportunities for accelerating RL workflows, if efficiently
harvested for rollout.
  In this paper, we present RLBoost, a systematic solution for cost-efficient
RL training that harvests preemptible GPU resources. Our key insight is that
rollout's stateless and embarrassingly parallel nature aligns perfectly with
preemptible and often fragmented resources. To efficiently utilize these
resources despite frequent and unpredictable availability changes, RLBoost
adopts a hybrid architecture with three key techniques: (1) adaptive rollout
offload to dynamically adjust workloads on the reserved (on-demand) cluster,
(2) pull-based weight transfer that quickly provisions newly available
instances, and (3) token-level response collection and migration for efficient
preemption handling and continuous load balancing. Extensive experiments show
RLBoost increases training throughput by 1.51x-1.97x while improving cost
efficiency by 28%-49% compared to using only on-demand GPU resources.</p>

market-dependent pricing map with a small neural network. We instantiate the
workflow on a rough volatility model with tempered-stable jumps tailored to
power-type volatility derivatives and calibrate it to VIX options with a
global-to-local search. We verify that a pure-jump rough volatility model
adequately captures the VIX dynamics, consistent with prior empirical findings,
and demonstrate that our calibration method achieves high accuracy and speed.</p>

<p>Effective biomedical data integration depends on automated term
normalization, the mapping of natural language biomedical terms to standardized
identifiers. This linking of terms to identifiers is essential for semantic
interoperability. Large language models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s) show promise for this task but
perform unevenly across terminologies. We evaluated both memorization
(training-term performance) and generalization (validation-term performance)
across multiple biomedical ontologies. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B revealed marked
differences by terminology. GO mappings showed strong memorization gains (up to
77% improvement in term-to-identifier accuracy), whereas HPO showed minimal
improvement. Generalization occurred only for protein-gene (GENE) mappings
(13.9% gain), while fine-tuning for HPO and GO yielded negligible transfer.
Baseline accuracy varied by model scale, with GPT-4o outperforming both Llama
variants for all terminologies. Embedding analyses showed tight semantic
alignment between gene symbols and protein names but weak alignment between
terms and identifiers for GO or HPO, consistent with limited lexicalization.
Fine-tuning success depended on two interacting factors: identifier popularity
and lexicalization. Popular identifiers were more likely encountered during
pretraining, enhancing memorization. Lexicalized identifiers, such as gene
symbols, enabled semantic generalization. By contrast, arbitrary identifiers in
GO and HPO constrained models to rote learning. These findings provide a
predictive framework for when fine-tuning enhances factual recall versus when
it fails due to <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> or non-lexicalized identifiers.</p>

alongside melt-processability and solubility requirements. From over 20,000

Quantization (BQQ). In contrast to conventional first-order <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080" /></a>

approximate real-valued matrices via linear combinations of binary bases, BQQ
leverages the expressive power of binary quadratic expressions while
maintaining an extremely compact data format. We validate our approach with two
experiments: a matrix <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" /></a> benchmark and post-training <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080" /></a>
(PTQ) on pretrained Vision Transformer-based models. Experimental results
demonstrate that BQQ consistently achieves a superior trade-off between memory
efficiency and reconstruction error than conventional methods for compressing
diverse matrix data. It also delivers strong PTQ performance, even though we
neither target state-of-the-art PTQ accuracy under tight memory constraints nor
rely on PTQ-specific binary matrix optimization. For example, our proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art PTQ method by up to 2.2\% and 59.1% on
the ImageNet dataset under the calibration-based and data-free scenarios,
respectively, with <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080" /></a> equivalent to 2 bits.

the surprising effectiveness of binary quadratic expressions for efficient

particularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model

especially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which
further accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can
be computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization.
To overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which
applies <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080" /></a> directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a
considerable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by
proposing a novel one-shot <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080" /></a> framework that relies on explainable deep
learning. First, we introduce a causal-aware <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080" /></a> approach that leverages

network, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of
the model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network
and vision <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a> baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we
demonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in
model size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for
fine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the
best trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.</p>

<p>Object-goal navigation (ObjNav) tasks an agent with navigating to the

limited model capacity for understanding complex navigation maps, which
prevents deploying ObjNav on local devices. At the same time, the long prompt

<p>Product search is a crucial component of modern e-commerce platforms, with
billions of user queries every day. In product search systems, first-stage
retrieval should achieve high recall while ensuring efficient online
deployment. Sparse retrieval is particularly attractive in this context due to
its interpretability and storage efficiency. However, <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> retrieval methods
suffer from severe vocabulary mismatch issues, leading to suboptimal

challenges:(1)Queries and product titles are typically short and highly

expansion terms or underweighting critical literal terms like brand names and

alleviates hallucination in lexical expansion by reinforcing underweighted
literal terms through a residual compensation mechanism; and (2)A lexical

coarse-to-fine sparsification strategy.Extensive offline and online experiments

<p>The extraction of pharmacological knowledge from regulatory documents has
become a key focus in biomedical natural language processing, with applications
ranging from adverse event monitoring to AI-assisted clinical decision support.
However, research in this field has predominantly relied on English-language
corpora such as DrugBank, leaving a significant gap in resources tailored to
other healthcare systems. To address this limitation, we introduce DART (Drug
Annotation from Regulatory Texts), the first structured corpus of Italian
Summaries of Product Characteristics derived from the official repository of
the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA). The dataset was built through a
reproducible pipeline encompassing web-scale document retrieval, semantic
segmentation of regulatory sections, and clinical summarization using a
few-shot-tuned large language model with low-temperature <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080" /></a>. DART
provides structured information on key pharmacological domains such as
indications, adverse drug reactions, and drug-drug interactions. To validate
its utility, we implemented an <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>-based drug interaction checker that
leverages the dataset to infer clinically meaningful interactions. Experimental
results show that instruction-tuned <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s can accurately infer potential
interactions and their clinical implications when grounded in the structured
textual fields of DART. We publicly release our code on GitHub:

capabilities, but scaling their performance often relies on massive reasoning
datasets that are computationally expensive to train on. Existing data
selection methods aim to curate smaller, high-quality subsets but often rely on
costly external models or opaque heuristics. In this work, we shift the focus
from external heuristics to the model's internal mechanisms. We find that
complex reasoning tasks consistently activate a <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a>, specialized subset of
attention heads, forming core reasoning circuits. Building on this insight, we
propose CircuitSeer, a novel data selection method that quantifies the
reasoning complexity of data by measuring its influence on these crucial
circuits. Extensive experiments on 4 models and 9 datasets demonstrate
CircuitSeer's superiority. Notably, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on just 10% of

smaller, more efficient small language models (SLMs) is a key challenge for
their practical application. The predominant approach, supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), suffers from poor generalization as it trains models to imitate a static
set of teacher trajectories rather than learn a robust methodology. While
reinforcement learning (RL) offers an alternative, the standard RL using <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a>
rewards fails to effectively guide SLMs, causing them to struggle with
inefficient exploration and adopt suboptimal strategies. To address these
distinct challenges, we propose MENTOR, a framework that synergistically
combines RL with teacher-guided distillation. Instead of simple imitation,
MENTOR employs an RL-based process to learn a more generalizable policy through
exploration. In addition, to solve the problem of reward <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" /></a>, it uses a

reward that provides fine-grained guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate

assigning an importance score to each weight, and then keep the weights with

<p>Human-Object Interaction Detection (HOI-DET) aims to localize human-object
pairs and identify their interactive relationships. To aggregate contextual
cues, existing methods typically propagate information across all detected
entities via self-attention mechanisms, or establish message passing between
humans and objects with bipartite graphs. However, they primarily focus on
pairwise relationships, overlooking that interactions in real-world scenarios
often emerge from collective behaviors (multiple humans and objects engaging in
joint activities). In light of this, we revisit relation modeling from a group
view and propose GroupHOI, a framework that propagates contextual information
in terms of geometric proximity and semantic similarity. To exploit the
geometric proximity, humans and objects are grouped into distinct clusters
using a learnable proximity estimator based on spatial features derived from
bounding boxes. In each group, a soft correspondence is computed via
self-attention to aggregate and dispatch contextual cues. To incorporate the
semantic similarity, we enhance the vanilla <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a>-based interaction

on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of GroupHOI over
the state-of-the-art methods. It also exhibits leading performance on the more
challenging Nonverbal Interaction Detection (NVI-DET) task, which involves
varied forms of higher-order interactions within groups.</p>

<p>Unlike offline processing, streaming video vision-language models face two

<p>High-quality pre-training data is crutial for large language models, where
quality captures factual reliability and semantic value, and diversity ensures
broad coverage and distributional heterogeneity. Existing approaches typically
rely on single or multiple-dimensional score-based selection. However, directly
selecting top-scored data often degrades performance, and sampling from a
broader range is required to recover results. The above non-monotonicity
between dataset scores and downstream benchmark results reveals a fundamental
bias: score-based methods collapse correlated dimensions, causing top-scored
data to appear high-quality while systematically overlooking diversity. We
argue that ensuring diversity requires decomposing correlated metrics into
orthogonal feature dimensions, from which the top-scored data can be directly
selected. Therefore, we proposed the Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection
(ODiS) algorithm, which preserves both quality and diversity during data
selection. First, ODiS evaluates data from multiple dimensions, covering
language quality, knowledge quality, and comprehension difficulty. The
multi-dimensional scores are then decorrelated via Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), yielding orthogonal evaluation dimensions. For each dimension, a
Roberta-based scorer is trained to regress the data onto PCA-projected scores,
enabling scalable inference on large corpora. Finally, ODiS constructs the
training dataset by selecting top-scored data within each orthogonal dimension,
thereby ensuring both quality and diversity. Empirical results show that
ODiS-selected data exhibit less than 2\% inter-dimension <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" /></a>, confirming
orthogonality between dimensions. More importantly, models trained with
ODiS-selected data significantly outperform other baselines on downstream
benchmarks, highlighting the necessity of orthogonal, diversity-aware data

<p>Mechanistic interpretability strives to explain model behavior in terms of
bottom-up primitives. The leading paradigm is to express hidden states as a
<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> linear combination of basis vectors, called features. However, this only
identifies which text sequences (exemplars) activate which features; the actual
interpretation of features requires subjective inspection of these exemplars.
This paper advocates for a different solution: rule-based descriptions that
match token patterns in the input and correspondingly increase or decrease the
likelihood of specific output tokens. Specifically, we extract rule-based
descriptions of SAE features trained on the outputs of attention layers. While
prior work treats the attention layers as an opaque box, we describe how it may
naturally be expressed in terms of interactions between input and output
features, of which we study three types: (1) skip-gram rules of the form
"[Canadian city]... speaks --&gt; English", (2) absence rules of the form
"[Montreal]... speaks -/-&gt; English," and (3) counting rules that toggle only
when the count of a word exceeds a certain value or the count of another word.
Absence and counting rules are not readily discovered by inspection of
exemplars, where manual and automatic descriptions often identify misleading or
incomplete explanations. We then describe a simple approach to extract these
types of rules automatically from a <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a>, and apply it to GPT-2 small.
We find that a majority of features may be described well with around 100
skip-gram rules, though absence rules are abundant even as early as the first
layer (in over a fourth of features). We also isolate a few examples of
counting rules. This paper lays the groundwork for future research into
rule-based descriptions of features by defining them, showing how they may be
extracted, and providing a preliminary taxonomy of some of the behaviors they
represent.</p>

depths? To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an
effective inference-time defense with negligible overhead. ADA is built based
on our observation that alignment is concentrated in the assistant header
tokens through repeated use in shallow-refusal training, and these tokens
possess the model's strong alignment priors. By reintroducing these tokens
mid-stream, ADA induces the model to reassess harmfulness and recover refusals
at any point in generation. Across diverse open-source model families (Llama,
Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and gpt-oss), ADA achieves robust safety
performance without requiring any changes to the base model's parameters. It
secures a near-100% refusal rate against challenging adversarial <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/prefill-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/prefill-F08080" /></a>

the average success rate of prominent adversarial prompt attacks (such as GCG,

<p>Modelling the complex spatiotemporal patterns of large-scale brain dynamics
is crucial for neuroscience, but traditional methods fail to capture the rich
structure in modalities such as magnetoencephalography (MEG). Recent advances
in deep learning have enabled significant progress in other domains, such as
language and vision, by using foundation models at scale. Here, we introduce

time-point prediction. To facilitate this, we also introduce a novel
data-driven tokeniser for continuous MEG data, which preserves the high
temporal resolution of continuous MEG signals without lossy transformations. We
trained MEG-GPT on tokenised brain region time-courses extracted from a
large-scale MEG dataset (N=612, eyes-closed rest, Cam-CAN data), and show that
the learnt model can generate data with realistic spatio-spectral properties,
including transient events and population variability. Critically, it performs
well in downstream <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080" /></a> tasks, improving downstream supervised prediction
task, showing improved zero-shot generalisation across sessions (improving
accuracy from 0.54 to 0.59) and subjects (improving accuracy from 0.41 to 0.49)

<p>Differentiating cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (CPE) from non-cardiogenic and
structurally normal lungs in lung ultrasound (LUS) videos remains challenging
due to the high visual variability of non-cardiogenic inflammatory patterns
(NCIP/ARDS-like), interstitial lung disease, and healthy lungs. This
heterogeneity complicates automated classification as <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" /></a>ping B-lines and
pleural artefacts are common. We introduce ZACH-ViT (Zero-token Adaptive
Compact Hierarchical Vision Transformer), a 0.25 M-parameter Vision Transformer
variant that removes both positional embeddings and the [CLS] token, making it
fully permutation-invariant and suitable for unordered medical image data. To
enhance generalization, we propose ShuffleStrides Data Augmentation (SSDA),

anatomical validity. ZACH-ViT was evaluated on 380 LUS videos from 95
critically ill patients against nine state-of-the-art baselines. Despite the
heterogeneity of the non-cardiogenic group, ZACH-ViT achieved the highest
validation and test ROC-AUC (0.80 and 0.79) with balanced sensitivity (0.60)
and specificity (0.91), while all competing models collapsed to trivial
classification. It trains 1.35x faster than Minimal ViT (0.62M parameters) with
2.5x fewer parameters, supporting real-time clinical deployment. These results
show that aligning architectural design with data structure can outperform

The LCG is trained using
norm-adjusted self-distillation to predict appropriate language families and
apply masking only when needed. Our method is based on the findings that
language confusion is infrequent, correct-language tokens are usually among the
top predictions, and output token embedding norms are larger for high-resource
languages, which biases sampling. When evaluated across various models,
including Qwen3, GPT-OSS, Gemma3, Llama3.1, LCG decreases language confusion
significantly, often by an order of magnitude, without negatively impacting
task performance. Code is available at

<p>We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovations are (1) a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining, (2) an
information-theoretic recruitment mechanism that adaptively allocates semantic
blocks as needed, eliminating the requirement for complete domain knowledge at
initialization, and (3) a hierarchical recruitment framework that extends
capacity allocation to entire specialized <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s, enabling multi-granularity

<p>Control-flow hijacking attacks manipulate orchestration mechanisms in
multi-agent systems into performing unsafe actions that compromise the system
and exfiltrate sensitive information. Recently proposed defenses, such as
LlamaFirewall, rely on alignment checks of inter-agent <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" /></a>s to ensure
that all agent invocations are "related to" and "likely to further" the
original objective.
  We start by demonstrating control-flow hijacking attacks that evade these
defenses even if alignment checks are performed by advanced <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s. We argue that
the safety and functionality objectives of multi-agent systems fundamentally
conflict with each other. This conflict is exacerbated by the brittle
definitions of "alignment" and the checkers' incomplete visibility into the
execution context.
  We then propose, implement, and evaluate ControlValve, a new defense inspired
by the principles of control-flow integrity and least privilege. ControlValve
(1) generates permitted control-flow graphs for multi-agent systems, and (2)
enforces that all executions comply with these graphs, along with contextual
rules (generated in a zero-shot manner) for each agent invocation.</p>

encoding from reasoning generation, thereby ensuring alignment and enabling
true concurrency. We evaluate StreamingThinker on the Qwen3 model family across
math reasoning, logical reasoning, and context-based QA reasoning tasks.
Experimental results show that the StreamingThinker preserves performance
comparable to batch thinking, while yielding an 80\% reduction in token waiting
before the onset of reasoning and a more than 60\% reduction in time-level

<p>Dataset search has been an established information retrieval task. Current
paradigms either retrieve datasets that are relevant to a keyword query or find
datasets that are similar to an input target dataset. To allow for their
combined specification of information needs, in this article, we investigate
the more generalized task of Dataset Search with Examples (DSE) and further
extend it to Explainable DSE that requires identifying the metadata and content
fields of a dataset that indicate its relevance to the query and similarity to
the target datasets. To facilitate this research, we construct DSEBench, a test
collection that provides high-quality dataset- and field-level annotations to
enable the evaluation of explainable DSE. We also employ a large language model
to generate numerous annotations to be used for training. We establish
extensive baselines on DSEBench by adapting and evaluating a variety of <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a>,

embarrassment from mistakes drives rapid correction, as observed in training a
puppy to avoid repeating errors after a single scolding CosmoCore tags code
generation trajectories with valence and surprise using a lightweight
multi-layer perceptron (MLP). High-negative valence (cringe) episodes, such as
buggy code outputs, are prioritized in a Dream Queue for five-fold replay
during off-policy updates, while low-surprise successes are pruned to prevent
overconfidence and buffer bloat. Evaluated on code generation benchmarks like
HumanEval and BigCodeBench, alongside simulations with a custom data pipeline
environment, CosmoCore reduces hallucinated code (e.g., syntax errors or
logical bugs) by 48\% and accelerates self-correction by 45\%. Local
experiments using Hugging Face models in a PySpark environment validate these
gains, with code snippets provided for replication. Ablations confirm valence
tagging boosts curiosity in exploration, and <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080" /></a> mitigates inefficiency.

<p>As the capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) advance, they can

approaches, whether based on attention or diversity, typically neglect the
guidance of the text prompt and thus fail to prioritize task relevance. In this
work, we propose a novel, zero-shot method that reframes the problem by
introducing a prompt-aware perspective, explicitly modeling visual token

hierarchical approach first selects a core set of task-relevant visual tokens
and then supplements them with diversity tokens to preserve broader context.
Experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that our method achieves
performance that matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art with only minimal

during irony comprehension. Irony provides an ideal paradigm because it
requires distinguishing intentional contradictions from unintended errors
through effortful semantic reanalysis. We compared behavioral and neural
responses to ironic statements from AI versus human sources using established
ERP components: P200 reflecting early incongruity detection and P600 indexing
cognitive efforts in reinterpreting incongruity as deliberate irony. Results
demonstrate that people do not fully adopt the intentional stance toward

AI-generated irony, suggesting reduced effortful detection and reanalysis
consistent with diminished attribution of communicative intent. Notably, people
who perceived AI as more sincere showed larger P200 and P600 effects for

<p>Smart contracts play a significant role in automating blockchain services.
Nevertheless, vulnerabilities in smart contracts pose serious threats to
blockchain security. Currently, traditional detection methods primarily rely on
static analysis and formal verification, which can result in high
false-positive rates and poor scalability. Large Language Models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s) have
recently made significant progress in smart contract vulnerability detection.
However, they still face challenges such as high inference costs and
substantial computational overhead. In this paper, we propose ParaVul, a
parallel <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> and retrieval-augmented framework to improve the reliability and
accuracy of smart contract vulnerability detection. Specifically, we first
develop Sparse Low-Rank Adaptation (SLoRA) for <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> fine-tuning. SLoRA
introduces sparsification by incorporating a <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> matrix into <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantize-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantize-F08080" /></a>d

requirements while enhancing their ability to understand vulnerability-related
issues. We then construct a vulnerability contract dataset and develop a hybrid
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that integrates dense retrieval
with Best Matching 25 (BM25), assisting in verifying the results generated by
the <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>. Furthermore, we propose a meta-learning model to fuse the outputs of
the RAG system and the <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>, thereby generating the final detection results.
After completing vulnerability detection, we design chain-of-thought prompts to
guide <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s to generate comprehensive vulnerability detection reports.
Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of ParaVul, especially in terms
of F1 scores, achieving 0.9398 for single-label detection and 0.9330 for
multi-label detection.</p>

effectively localize natural language queries in videos through a two-stage
process. Rather than being directly grounded, language queries are initially
transformed into enriched sentences that incorporate missing details and cues
to aid in grounding. In the second stage, these enriched queries are grounded,
using a lightweight <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>r, which specializes at predicting accurate

<p>Generalizing to unseen graph tasks without task-specific supervision is

that unifies structural and semantic reasoning. The encoder augments a

structure-aware graph-text attention mechanism, enabling it to attend jointly
to a tokenized graph and a natural-language task prompt while remaining
permutation-invariant to node order. This yields compact, task-aware graph
representations. Conditioned solely on these representations, a frozen <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>

simultaneously paraphrases the input graph in natural language. The
reconstruction objective regularizes the encoder to preserve structural cues.
UniGTE is instruction-tuned on five datasets spanning node-level, edge-level,

<p>The escalating threat of weapon-related violence necessitates automated

assessment in real-time security applications. Traditional weapon detection
approaches rely on object detection frameworks that provide only coarse

Neuronal Group Communication (NGC), a theory-driven framework that reimagines a
neural network as a dynamical system of interacting neuronal groups rather than
a monolithic collection of neural weights. Instead of treating each weight as
an independent trainable parameter, NGC treats weights as transient
interactions between embedding-like neuronal states, with neural computation
unfolding through iterative <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" /></a> among groups of neurons. This
low-rank, modular representation yields compact models: groups of neurons
exchange low-dimensional signals, enabling intra-group specialization and
inter-group information sharing while dramatically reducing redundant
parameters. By drawing on dynamical systems theory, we introduce a neuronal
stability metric (analogous to Lyapunov stability) that quantifies the
contraction of neuron activations toward stable patterns during sequence
processing. Using this metric, we reveal that emergent reasoning capabilities
correspond to an external driving force or ``potential'', which nudges the
neural dynamics away from trivial trajectories while pre<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00" /></a> stability.
Empirically, we instantiate NGC in large language models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s) and demonstrate
improved performance on complex reasoning benchmarks under moderate

NGC consistently outperforms standard low-rank approximations and
cross-layer basis-sharing methods at comparable <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" /></a> rates. We conclude
by discussing the broader implications of NGC, including how structured
neuronal group dynamics might relate to generalization in high-dimensional
learning systems.</p>

<p>Transformer models have driven breakthroughs across various language tasks by
their strong capability to learn rich contextual representations. Scaling them
to improve representation, however, often demands substantial memory and
compute costs, such as the Key-Value (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/KV-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/KV-F08080" /></a>) <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/cache-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/cache-F08080" /></a> used during auto-regressive

without bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve
expressivity while leaving <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/KV-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/KV-F08080" /></a> costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of
weaker representation. In this work, we propose SkipV1Former, a Transformer
variant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to
strengthen model representation and reduce <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/KV-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/KV-F08080" /></a> <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/cache-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/cache-F08080" /></a>. Specifically, from the
second block onward, each layer reuses half of its Value heads from the very
first layer, while computing the other half as usual-cutting Value projections
and V <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/cache-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/cache-F08080" /></a> by nearly 50 \%. Theoretically, we show that routing uncompressed

and accelerates the model's implicit mesa-optimization-a key pattern of
Transformer in auto-regressive tasks. Empirically, across different model
scales, SkipV1Former delivers consistent reductions of approximately 25 \% in

10-15\% additional compute. Finally, SkipV1Former can seamlessly combine

sufficient 2D context for reconstructing re-masked atoms. To address these

Selective Re-mask Decoding(SRD), which re-masks only 3D-relevant information

exploration of pre-trained vision foundation models or advanced fine-tuning
techniques. Mainstream frameworks either avoid fine-tuning or utilize
simplistic methods like LoRA, often neglecting the potential of enhancing
cross-attention mechanisms. Additionally, while Transformer-based models
dominate vision-language tasks, non-Transformer architectures, such as the
Mamba network, remain underexplored for medical report generation, presenting a
promising avenue for future research. In this paper, we propose EMRRG, a novel
X-ray report generation framework that fine-tunes pre-trained Mamba networks
using parameter-efficient methods. Specifically, X-ray images are divided into
patches, tokenized, and processed by an SSM-based vision backbone for feature

this work, we unify these two paradigms into a novel, end-to-end trainable
framework named L-MoE: a Lightweight Mixture of LoRA Experts. L-MoE redefines
MoE experts not as dense feed-forward networks, but as a collection of
task-specialized, low-rank adapters. A lightweight gating network, trained
jointly with the experts, learns to dynamically compose these LoRA adapters by
computing a weighted average of their parameters for each input token. This
composition is fully differentiable, allowing gradients from a standard
auto-regressive language modeling objective to flow back through the entire
architecture, simultaneously refining both the expert adapters and the routing
strategy. This approach creates a highly parameter-efficient MoE model that is
modular by design, allows for dynamic skill composition, and is trainable from
end-to-end. We present the formal mathematical framework for L-MoE, detailing
the differentiable routing mechanism and the joint optimization objective,
thereby providing a new path toward building more efficient, scalable, and
specialized language models.</p>

<p>Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MKGs) extend traditional knowledge graphs by
incorporating visual and textual modalities, enabling richer and more
expressive entity representations. However, existing MKGs often suffer from
incompleteness, which hinder their effectiveness in downstream tasks.
Therefore, multimodal knowledge graph completion (MKGC) task is receiving
increasing attention. While large language models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s) have shown promise for
knowledge graph completion (KGC), their application to the multimodal setting
remains underexplored. Moreover, applying Multimodal Large Language Models
(M<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s) to the task of MKGC introduces significant challenges: (1) the large
number of image tokens per entity leads to semantic noise and modality
conflicts, and (2) the high computational cost of processing large token
inputs. To address these issues, we propose Efficient Lightweight Multimodal
Large Language Models (ELMM) for MKGC. ELMM proposes a Multi-view Visual Token
Compressor (MVTC) based on multi-head attention mechanism, which adaptively
compresses image tokens from both textual and visual views, thereby effectively
reducing redundancy while retaining necessary information and avoiding modality
conflicts. Additionally, we design an attention <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080" /></a> strategy to remove

SegDeformer, which offer superior performance at the cost of higher

both in-car and distributed applications, despite SegDeformer's computational
demands. This improves scalability in the cloud while reducing in-car
computational complexity. For the in-car application, we increased the frames

and memory costs with respect to sequence length, posing a major bottleneck for
long-context training. Prior work tackles this challenge along two directions:
(1) kernel-level optimizations, which accelerate dense and <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> attention
operators; and (2) module-level strategies, often referred to as distributed
attention or context parallel training, which scale attention across multiple
devices. However, systematic evaluation still remains limited: operator-level
comparisons are often incomplete, while context parallel strategies are
typically framework-specific, with unclear performance analysis across
contexts. To address these gaps, we propose a unified benchmark that integrates
representative attention kernels and context parallel mechanisms with a modular
and extensible interface for evaluation. The benchmark evaluates methods along
two critical dimensions: (1) attention mask patterns, which strongly affect
efficiency, scalability, and usability, and (2) sequence length and distributed
scale, which determine performance under extreme long-context training. Through
comprehensive experiments on the cluster of up to 96 GPUs, our benchmark
enables reproducible comparisons, highlights method-specific trade-offs, and
provides practical guidance for designing and deploying attention mechanisms in

<p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in diverse cross-modal tasks.
However, object hallucination, where models produce plausible but inaccurate
object descriptions, remains a significant challenge. In contrast to previous
work focusing on <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> components, this paper is the first to trace LVLM
hallucinations to visual encoders and identifies three key issues: statistical
bias, inherent bias, and vulnerability. To address these challenges, we propose
SHIELD, a training-free framework that mitigates hallucinations through three
strategies: re-weighting visual tokens to reduce statistical bias, introducing
noise-derived tokens to counter inherent bias, and applying adversarial attacks
with contrastive <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080" /></a> to address vulnerability. Experiments demonstrate
that SHIELD effectively mitigates object hallucinations across diverse
benchmarks and LVLM families. Moreover, SHIELD achieves strong performance on
the general LVLM benchmark, highlighting its broad applicability. Code will be

evaluators remains underexplored. We introduce CoReEval, the first large-scale

The benchmark spans 3 programming languages (Java, Python, CUDA), 2 code types

static model, analyzing numerical alignment (MAE, Pearson's, Spearman's) and
justification quality (sentiment, aspect coverage, semantic clustering). Our
findings show that developer-guided prompting grounded in human-defined
readability dimensions improves alignment in structured contexts, enhances
explanation quality, and enables lightweight personalization through persona
framing. However, increased score variability highlights trade-offs between
alignment, stability, and interpretability. CoReEval provides a robust

populations grow, this limitation produces brittle collective behavior, where
individually smart agents converge on poor group outcomes. We introduce the
Ripple Effect Protocol (REP), a coordination protocol in which agents share not
only their decisions but also lightweight sensitivities - signals expressing
how their choices would change if key environmental variables shifted. These
sensitivities ripple through local networks, enabling groups to align faster
and more stably than with agent-centric <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" /></a> alone. We formalize REP's
protocol specification, separating required message schemas from optional
aggregation rules, and evaluate it across scenarios with varying incentives and
network topologies. Benchmarks across three domains: (i) supply chain cascades

<p>Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled fast,
photorealistic rendering of dynamic 3D scenes, showing strong potential in
immersive <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" /></a>. However, in digital human encoding and transmission,

the lack of human priors, resulting in suboptimal bitrate efficiency and
reconstruction quality at the <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>r side, which hinders their application in
streamable 3D avatar systems. We propose HGC-Avatar, a novel Hierarchical
Gaussian Compression framework designed for efficient transmission and
high-quality rendering of dynamic avatars. Our method disentangles the Gaussian
representation into a structural layer, which maps poses to Gaussians via a
StyleUNet-based generator, and a motion layer, which leverages the SMPL-X model
to represent temporal pose variations compactly and semantically. This
hierarchical design supports layer-wise <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" /></a>, progressive <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080" /></a>, and
controllable rendering from diverse pose inputs such as video sequences or
text. Since people are most concerned with facial realism, we incorporate a
facial attention mechanism during StyleUNet training to preserve identity and

demonstrate that HGC-Avatar provides a streamable solution for rapid 3D avatar

expansive input contexts, yet such verbosity inflates monetary costs, carbon
footprint, and inference-time latency. Much of this overhead manifests from the
redundant low-utility tokens present in typical prompts, as only a fraction of
tokens typically carries the majority of the semantic weight. We address this
inefficiency by introducing FrugalPrompt, a novel prompt <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" /></a> framework

Leveraging two state-of-the-art token attribution methods, GlobEnc and DecompX,
we assign salience scores to every token in an input sequence, rank them to
preserve the top-k% tokens in their original order, and obtain a <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a>
frugalized prompt. We evaluate the approach across four NLP tasks: Sentiment
Analysis, Commonsense QA, Summarization, and Mathematical Reasoning, using a
suite of frontier <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s. For the first three tasks, a 20% prompt reduction
incurs only a marginal loss in task performance, demonstrating that
contemporary <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s can reconstruct elided context from high-salience cues. In
contrast, performance on mathematical reasoning deteriorates sharply,
reflecting a stronger dependence on complete token continuity. Further analysis
with bottom-k% and random-k% tokens reveals asymmetric performance patterns
that may suggest potential task contamination effects, wherein models may
resort to shallow memorized patterns from pretraining exposure for conventional
NLP tasks. We posit that our work contributes to a more nuanced understanding
of <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> behavior in performance-efficiency trade-offs, and delineate the

We rigorously demonstrate that

FourierCompress transforms activations into the frequency domain, retains only
a compact block of low-frequency coefficients, and reconstructs the signal at
the server using conjugate symmetry, enabling seamless hardware <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/acceleration-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/acceleration-F08080" /></a> on

<p>Large Language Models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have
demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities. To further enhance <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>
capabilities, recent agentic systems, such as Deep Research, incorporate web
interactions into <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> reasoning to mitigate uncertainties and reduce potential
errors. However, existing research predominantly focuses on reasoning
performance, often neglecting the efficiency of agentic systems. In this work,
we present a comprehensive empirical study that identifies efficiency
bottlenecks in web-interactive agentic systems. We decompose end-to-end latency
into two primary components: <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> API latency and web environment latency. We
conduct a comprehensive empirical study across 15 models and 5 providers to
demonstrate high variability in API-based agentic systems. We observe that web
environment latency can contribute as much as 53.7% to the overall latency in a
web-based agentic system. To improve latency, we propose SpecCache, a caching
framework augmented with speculative execution that can reduce web environment
overhead. Extensive evaluations on two standard benchmarks show that our
approach improves the <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/cache-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/cache-F08080" /></a> hit rate by up to 58x compared to a random caching
strategy, while reducing web environment overhead by up to 3.2x, without
degrading agentic system performance.</p>

<p>Recent advances in neural networks have led to significant computational and
memory demands, spurring interest in one-bit weight <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" /></a> to enable
efficient inference on resource-constrained devices. However, the theoretical
underpinnings of such <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" /></a> remain poorly understood. We address this gap
by analyzing one-bit <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080" /></a> in the Random Features model, a simplified
framework that corresponds to neural networks with random representations. We
prove that, asymptotically, quantizing weights of all layers except the last
incurs no loss in generalization error, compared to the full precision random
features model. Our findings offer theoretical insights into neural network

We also demonstrate empirically that one-bit <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080" /></a> leads to
significant inference speed ups for the Random Features models even on a laptop
GPU, confirming the practical benefits of our work. Additionally, we provide an
asymptotically precise characterization of the generalization error for Random
Features with an arbitrary number of layers. To the best of our knowledge, our
analysis yields more general results than all previous works in the related
literature.</p>

<p>Malicious agents pose significant threats to the reliability and
decision-making capabilities of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large
Language Models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s). Existing defenses often fall short due to reactive
designs or centralized architectures which may introduce single points of
failure. To address these challenges, we propose SentinelNet, the first
decentralized framework for proactively detecting and mitigating malicious
behaviors in multi-agent collaboration. SentinelNet equips each agent with a
credit-based detector trained via contrastive learning on augmented adversarial
debate trajectories, enabling autonomous evaluation of message credibility and
dynamic neighbor ranking via bottom-k elimination to suppress malicious
<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" /></a>s. To overcome the scarcity of attack data, it generates
adversarial trajectories simulating diverse threats, ensuring robust training.
Experiments on MAS benchmarks show SentinelNet achieves near-perfect detection
of malicious agents, close to 100% within two debate rounds, and recovers 95%
of system accuracy from compromised baselines. By exhibiting strong
generalizability across domains and attack patterns, SentinelNet establishes a
novel paradigm for safeguarding collaborative MAS.</p>
