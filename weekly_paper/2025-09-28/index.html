<p>Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of
large-scale <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a>s. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs
severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has
become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we
empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing
billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed
activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes
calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first
Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two
technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained
Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local
channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel
variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which
filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse
calibration clusters to ensure stable <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080" /></a> ranges. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results
across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art generic <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantization-F08080" /></a> method with a great margin. We highlight
that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7<script type="math/tex">\times</script> memory reduction and

of VLMs, by exploiting their heterogeneous resource demands during execution
and incorporating elastic GPU spatial partitioning among stages to maximally
utilize the compute and memory resources. Building on this, we introduce a
real-time scheduling algorithm that adaptively calibrates resource allocation
among stages based on a Pareto-optimal analysis of the latency-throughput
trade-off, allowing the system to sustain responsiveness and resource
efficiency under dynamic request loads. To further alleviate GPU memory
pressure, we design a lightweight weight offloading strategy for vision
encoders that preserves inference efficiency with minimized memory overhead.
Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world agent workloads
demonstrate that Nova consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines,
improving the maximum latency by up to 23.3%, while keeping competitive
throughput.</p>

<p>Long context training is crucial for <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>'s context extension. Existing

overhead. Pipeline parallelism (PP) reduces this cost, but its effectiveness
hinges on partitioning granularity. Batch-level PP dividing input samples
exhibits high memory consumption in long-context scenario, whereas token-level
PP splitting sequences into slices alleviates memory overhead but may incur
hardware under-utilization. This trade-off motivates adaptively selecting PP
granularity to match resource and workload characteristics. Moreover, sequence
length distribution of the real-world dataset exhibits skewness, posing a
challenge on PP's workload balance and efficient scheduling. Current static PP
scheduling methods overlook the variance of sequence length, leading to
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose Elastic Pipeline Parallelism
(EPP) that orchestrates token-level PP and batch-level PP to adapt to resource
and workload heterogeneity. We build InfiniPipe, a distributed training system
that unleashes the potential of EPP via (1) a resource-aware and
workload-balanced sequence processor that splits long sequences and packs short
ones; and (2) a co-optimization methodology that jointly optimizes pipeline
schedule and gradient checkpointing via a mechanism named stage-aware
chunk-level adaptive checkpointing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
InfiniPipe achieves a 1.69x speedup over state-of-the-art systems.</p>

<p>Real-time urban traffic surveillance is vital for Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) to ensure road safety, optimize traffic flow, track vehicle
trajectories, and prevent collisions in smart cities. Deploying edge cameras
across urban environments is a standard practice for monitoring road
conditions. However, integrating these with intelligent models requires a
robust understanding of dynamic traffic scenarios and a responsive interface
for user interaction. Although multimodal Large Language Models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s) can
interpret traffic images and generate informative responses, their deployment
on edge devices is infeasible due to high computational demands. Therefore, <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>
inference must occur on the cloud, necessitating visual data transmission from
edge to cloud, a process hindered by limited bandwidth, leading to potential
delays that compromise real-time performance. To address this challenge, we
propose a semantic <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" /></a> framework that significantly reduces
transmission overhead. Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs)
using YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into
compact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings
are then transmitted to the cloud, where an image <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>r reconstructs the

<p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced
the agentic capabilities of large language models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s). In long-term and
multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards
often suffer from the problem of <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped
agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the
complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search
sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of
tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory
naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even
using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped
relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level
group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct
preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based
RL method.</p>

<p>Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed,

challenging for <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond
which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable.
Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to
this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes
a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling
for single-pass <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses

capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s. Building on

information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness
by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the
reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate
our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns
with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance

positioning its computational understanding as one of the most challenging

structure enables both efficient prototype initialization and subsequent
editing. Text-guided CAD prototyping, which unifies Text-to-CAD generation and
CAD editing, has the potential to streamline the entire design pipeline.
However, prior work has not explored this setting, largely because standard
large language model (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>) tokenizers decompose CAD sequences into
natural-language word pieces, failing to capture primitive-level CAD semantics
and hindering attention modules from modeling geometric structure. We
conjecture that a multimodal tokenization strategy, aligned with CAD's
primitive and structural nature, can provide more effective representations. To
this end, we propose CAD-Tokenizer, a framework that represents CAD data with
modality-specific tokens using a sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level
pooling and constrained <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080" /></a>. This design produces compact, primitive-aware
representations that align with CAD's structural nature. Applied to unified
text-guided CAD prototyping, CAD-Tokenizer significantly improves instruction
following and generation quality, achieving better quantitative and qualitative
performance over both general-purpose <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s and task-specific baselines.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of expressive speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) is to
accurately translate spoken content while pre<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00" /></a> the speaker identity and
emotional style. However, progress in this field is largely hindered by three
key challenges: the scarcity of paired speech data that retains expressive
styles, the complexity of multi-stage processing pipelines, and the limited
transfer of translation capabilities from large language models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s). In this

framework for expressive S2ST. Our approach features carefully designed speech
semantic and style modeling, enabling seamless integration with existing

<p>Speech-aware Language Models (SpeechLMs) have fundamentally transformed
human-AI interaction by enabling voice-based <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/communication-F08080" /></a>, yet they may
exhibit acoustic-based gender differentiation where identical questions lead to
different responses based on the speaker's gender. This paper propose a new
dataset that enables systematic analysis of this phenomenon, containing 9,208
speech samples across three categories: Gender-Independent,
Gender-Stereotypical, and Gender-Dependent. We further evaluated LLaMA-Omni
series and discovered a paradoxical pattern; while overall responses seems
identical regardless of gender, the pattern is far from unbiased responses.
Specifically, in Gender-Stereotypical questions, all models consistently
exhibited male-oriented responses; meanwhile, in Gender-Dependent questions
where gender differentiation would be contextually appropriate, models
exhibited responses independent to gender instead. We also confirm that this
pattern does not result from neutral options nor perceived gender of a voice.
When we allow neutral response, models tends to respond neutrally also in
Gender-Dependent questions. The paradoxical pattern yet retains when we applied
gender neutralization methods on speech. Through comparison between SpeechLMs
with corresponding backbone <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s, we confirmed that these paradoxical patterns
primarily stem from Whisper speech encoders, which generates male-oriented
acoustic tokens. These findings reveal that current SpeechLMs may not
successfully remove gender biases though they prioritized general fairness
principles over contextual appropriateness, highlighting the need for more
sophisticated techniques to utilize gender information properly in speech
technology.</p>

formulation, MLA allows two functionally equivalent but computationally

(e.g., FlashAttention) are typically preferred in training and <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/prefill-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/prefill-F08080" /></a> for

on the absorb method to minimize HBM bandwidth usage. However, the
compute-bound nature of the absorb implementations prohibits performance
benefits from data reuse opportunities in attention calculations, such as
shared prefixes. In this work, we introduce TyphoonMLA, a hybrid approach that
combines naive and absorb formulations to harness the strengths of both.
TyphoonMLA effectively leverages the shared prefix by applying the naive
formulation to the compute-bound parts of attention calculations, while
reducing the bandwidth requirements for non-shared parts by using the absorb
formulation. As a result, TyphoonMLA improves the throughput of attention
calculations in MLA architectures by up to 3x and 3.24x on NPU and GPUs, with
only a 3% overhead in HBM size.</p>

<p>Robotic world models are a promising paradigm for forecasting future
environment states, yet their inference speed and the physical plausibility of
generated trajectories remain critical bottlenecks, limiting their real-world
applications. This stems from the redundancy of the prevailing frame-to-frame
generation approach, where the model conducts costly computation on similar
frames, as well as neglecting the semantic importance of key transitions. To
address this inefficiency, we propose KeyWorld, a framework that improves
text-conditioned robotic world models by concentrating <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a>s computation
on a few semantic key frames while employing a lightweight convolutional model
to fill the intermediate frames. Specifically, KeyWorld first identifies
significant transitions by iteratively simplifying the robot's motion
trajectories, obtaining the ground truth key frames. Then, a DiT model is
trained to reason and generate these physically meaningful key frames from
textual task descriptions. Finally, a lightweight interpolator efficiently
reconstructs the full video by inpainting all intermediate frames. Evaluations
on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that KeyWorld achieves a 5.68<script type="math/tex">\times</script>

atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that
enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby
promoting feature independence and <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" /></a> across instances. For efficient
entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step
function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we
term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major
applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably
estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and
leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s and In-context
Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract
atomized features from <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>'s hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature
extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to
avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense
features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among
baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00" /></a> as a feature

time-to-first-token (TTFT). Heuristic policies such as \textsc{LRU} often
struggle under structured access patterns. Learning-based approaches are
promising, but in practice face two major limitations: they degrade sharply
when predictions are inaccurate, or they gain little even with accurate
predictions due to conservative designs. Some also incur high overhead, further
limiting practicality.
  We present \textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching
that delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency. Its
core algorithm, \textsc{LARU}, enhances \textsc{LRU} with machine-learned
predictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error
estimation. When predictions are accurate, \textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal
performance. With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to
near-\textsc{LRU} performance. With \textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between
empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching.
  Experiments show that \textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic
conditions. In DLRM and <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\%

to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric
tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit
``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the
model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence
accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and
clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To
further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model
through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in
naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens
captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.</p>

computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction
settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms
multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling
efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical
analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in
higher multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the
generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on
the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model
trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger
baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for
long-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps. We also theoretically and
empirically validate the strong cross-task generalizability that the models
trained on complex tasks can lead to the successful completion of all simpler

Review System), a role-based collaboration framework inspired by the review

agents provide decisions and comments independently, and a meta-reviewer
integrates the feedback to make the final decision and guide further revision.
This design enhances reasoning quality while avoiding costly

<p>The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on
specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for
applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into
a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a
universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>r framework pre-computes
features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation
aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI
modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy,
improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for
effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger

<p>We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image
generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing,
and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly
efficient diffusion <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a> with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the
number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our
model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g.,
1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning
diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data
collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized
strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/acceleration-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/acceleration-F08080" /></a>, we integrate adversarial distillation,

4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and
multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both
creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on

<p>Implicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods offer a token-efficient alternative
to explicit CoT reasoning in Large Language Models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s), but a persistent
performance gap has limited their adoption. We identify a core latent
instability issue when scaling the computational budget of implicit CoT: as the
number of reasoning tokens increases, training often becomes unstable and
collapses. Our analysis shows that this instability arises from latent
representations becoming homogeneous and losing semantic diversity, caused by
insufficient step-level supervision in current implicit CoT methods. To address
this, we propose SIM-CoT, a plug-and-play training module that introduces
step-level supervision to stabilize and enrich the latent reasoning space.
SIM-CoT employs an auxiliary <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>r during training to align each implicit
token with its corresponding explicit reasoning step, ensuring latent states
capture distinct and meaningful information. The auxiliary <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>r is removed

It also provides interpretability by projecting each latent token onto an
explicit reasoning vocabulary, enabling per-step visualization and diagnosis.
SIM-CoT significantly improves both in-domain accuracy and out-of-domain
stability of implicit CoT methods, boosting Coconut by +8.2\% on GPT-2 and CODI
by +3.0\% on LLaMA-3.1 8B. It further surpasses the explicit CoT baseline on

<p>Multimodal data has significantly advanced recommendation systems by
integrating diverse information sources to model user preferences and item
characteristics. However, these systems often struggle with redundant and
irrelevant information, which can degrade performance. Most existing methods
either fuse multimodal information directly or use rigid architectural
separation for disentanglement, failing to adequately filter noise and model
the complex interplay between modalities. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework, the Multimodal Representation-disentangled
Information Bottleneck (MRdIB). Concretely, we first employ a Multimodal
Information Bottleneck to compress the input representations, effectively
filtering out task-irrelevant noise while pre<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00" /></a> rich semantic information.
Then, we decompose the information based on its relationship with the
recommendation target into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. We
achieve this decomposition with a series of constraints: a unique information
learning objective to preserve modality-unique signals, a redundant information
learning objective to minimize <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" /></a>, and a synergistic information learning
objective to capture emergent information. By optimizing these objectives,
MRdIB guides a model to learn more powerful and disentangled representations.
Extensive experiments on several competitive models and three benchmark
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our MRdIB in
enhancing multimodal recommendation.</p>

interest in extending their capabilities to multimodal scenarios, particularly
for speech-to-speech conversational systems. However, existing multimodal
models handling interleaved audio and text rely on autoregressive methods,
overlooking that text depends on target-target relations whereas audio depends
mainly on source-target relations. In this work, we propose Text-to-Talk (TtT),
a unified audio-text framework that integrates autoregressive (AR) text
generation with non-autoregressive (NAR) audio diffusion in a single
Transformer. By leveraging the any-order autoregressive property of absorbing
discrete diffusion, our approach provides a unified training objective for text
and audio. To support this hybrid generation paradigm, we design a
modality-aware attention mechanism that enforces causal <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080" /></a> for text while
allowing bidirectional modeling within audio spans, and further introduce three
training strategies that reduce train-test discrepancies. During inference, TtT
employs block-wise diffusion to synthesize audio in parallel while flexibly
handling variable-length outputs. Extensive experiments across Audio-QA and ASR
tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with detailed ablation
studies validating each proposed component. We will open-source our models,
data and code to facilitate future research in this direction.</p>

<p>Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) relocate learnable nonlinearities from
nodes to edges, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in scientific machine
learning and interpretable modeling. However, current KAN implementations
suffer from fundamental inefficiencies due to redundancy in high-dimensional
spline parameter spaces, where numerous distinct parameterisations yield
functionally equivalent behaviors. This redundancy manifests as a "nuisance
space" in the model's Jacobian, leading to susceptibility to overfitting and
poor generalization. We introduce Projective Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(P-KANs), a novel training framework that guides edge function discovery
towards interpretable functional representations through entropy-minimisation
techniques from signal analysis and <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> dictionary learning. Rather than
constraining functions to predetermined spaces, our approach maintains spline
space flexibility while introducing "gravitational" terms that encourage
convergence towards optimal functional representations. Our key insight
recognizes that optimal representations can be identified through entropy
analysis of projection coefficients, compressing edge functions to
lower-parameter projective spaces (Fourier, Chebyshev, Bessel). P-KANs
demonstrate superior performance across multiple domains, achieving up to 80%
parameter reduction while maintaining representational capacity, significantly
improved robustness to noise compared to standard KANs, and successful
application to industrial automated fiber placement prediction. Our approach
enables automatic discovery of mixed functional representations where different
edges converge to different optimal spaces, providing both <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" /></a> benefits

<p>Dialectal data are characterized by linguistic variation that appears small
to humans but has a significant impact on the performance of models. This
dialect gap has been related to various factors (e.g., data size, economic and
social factors) whose impact, however, turns out to be inconsistent. In this
work, we investigate factors impacting the model performance more directly: we
correlate Tokenization Parity (TP) and Information Parity (IP), as measures of
representational biases in pre-trained multilingual models, with the downstream
performance. We compare state-of-the-art <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>r-only <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s with encoder-based

extractive question answering, controlling for varying scripts (Latin vs.

TP is a better predictor of the performance on tasks reliant on syntactic and

details and structured density patterns. We introduce MeshMosaic, a novel
local-to-global framework for artist mesh generation that scales to over 100K
triangles--substantially surpassing prior methods, which typically handle only
around 8K faces. MeshMosaic first segments shapes into patches, generating each
patch autoregressively and leveraging shared boundary conditions to promote
coherence, symmetry, and seamless connectivity between neighboring regions.
This strategy enhances scalability to high-resolution meshes by quantizing
patches individually, resulting in more symmetrical and organized mesh density
and structure. Extensive experiments across multiple public datasets
demonstrate that MeshMosaic significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in both geometric fidelity and user preference, supporting superior detail
representation and practical mesh generation for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Clinical diagnosis is a highly specialized discipline requiring both domain
expertise and strict adherence to rigorous guidelines. While current AI-driven
medical research predominantly focuses on knowledge graphs or natural text
pretraining paradigms to incorporate medical knowledge, these approaches
primarily rely on implicitly encoded knowledge within model parameters,
neglecting task-specific knowledge required by diverse downstream tasks. To
address this limitation, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diagnosis (RAD), a
novel framework that explicitly injects external knowledge into multimodal
models directly on downstream tasks. Specifically, RAD operates through three
key mechanisms: retrieval and refinement of disease-centered knowledge from
multiple medical sources, a guideline-enhanced contrastive loss that constrains
the latent distance between multi-modal features and guideline knowledge, and
the dual <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a> <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>r that employs guidelines as queries to steer
cross-modal fusion, aligning the models with clinical diagnostic workflows from
guideline acquisition to feature extraction and decision-making. Moreover,
recognizing the lack of quantitative evaluation of interpretability for
multimodal diagnostic models, we introduce a set of criteria to assess the
interpretability from both image and text perspectives. Extensive evaluations
across four datasets with different anatomies demonstrate RAD's
generalizability, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, RAD
enables the model to concentrate more precisely on abnormal regions and
critical indicators, ensuring evidence-based, trustworthy diagnosis. Our code

we investigate a simple on-policy hybrid framework in a controlled, best-case

probability of dispreferred trajectories also reduces the probability of shared
useful tokens, leading to over-penalization and overall performance collapse.
As a mitigation, existing algorithms include the probability of a trajectory
under the current policy as a regularization term, which decreases the effect
of the gradient when the probability is low. However, by the time this effect
takes hold, useful tokens may have already been over-penalized as the model has
begun to degrade. To address this, we propose Future Policy Aware (FPA)
preference learning, which replaces the current policy with a future policy in
the regularization term. This future policy is estimated via lightweight,
logit-space extrapolation from a reference model toward the current model. FPA
enables safer training by preemptively regularizing potentially problematic
gradients. We apply FPA to DPO, RPO, and SimPER and evaluate them on the MATH
and GSM8K benchmarks. FPA yields consistent performance gains, with the largest
improvements observed with SimPER, achieving gains of up to 5.75%. We

<p>Collective action problems, which require aligning individual incentives with
collective goals, are classic examples of Ill-Structured Problems (ISPs). For
an individual agent, the causal links between local actions and global outcomes
are unclear, stakeholder objectives often conflict, and no single, clear
algorithm can bridge micro-level choices with macro-level welfare. We present
ECHO-MIMIC, a computational framework that converts this global complexity into
a tractable, Well-Structured Problem (WSP) for each agent by discovering
compact, executable heuristics and persuasive rationales. The framework
operates in two stages: ECHO (Evolutionary Crafting of Heuristics from
Outcomes) evolves snippets of Python code that encode candidate behavioral
policies, while MIMIC (Mechanism Inference &amp; Messaging for
Individual-to-Collective Alignment) evolves companion natural language messages
that motivate agents to adopt those policies. Both phases employ a

those that maximize collective performance in a simulated environment. We
demonstrate this framework on a canonical ISP in agricultural landscape

However, there is an intrinsic trade-off: while leveraging parallelism

accommodate larger context lengths, it inevitably results in degraded overall

(Gyges), which adaptively adjusts the parallelism strategies of running

<p>Test-time scaling (TTS) has recently emerged as a promising direction to

modeling in multivariate time series (MTS) data. On top of this, a growing
consensus in the field points to indiscriminate inter-variable mixing as a
potential source of noise-accumulation and performance degradation. This is
likely exacerbated by <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" /></a> of informative signals characteristic of many
MTS systems coupled with representational misalignment stemming from
indiscriminate information mixing between (heterogeneous) variables. While
scalability and performance are often seen as competing interests in

strategically constraining the representational capacity of inter-variable
mixing. Our proposed method, <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a> with Delegate Token Attention
(DELTAformer), constrains inter-variable modeling through what we call delegate
tokens which are then used to perform full, unconstrained, inter-temporal
modeling. Delegate tokens act as an implicit regularizer that forces the model
to be highly selective about what inter-variable information is allowed to
propagate through the network. Our results show that DELTAformer scales
linearly with variable-count while actually outperforming standard

Reward Learning (OPRL), a general credit-assignment strategy for agentic RL
that integrates seamlessly with standard on-policy algorithms without relying
on additional rollouts or explicit step labels. In OPRL, we optimize an
implicit process reward model (PRM) alternately with the agent's policy to
transform trajectory preferences into implicit step rewards through a
trajectory-based DPO objective. These step rewards are then used to compute
step-level advantages, which are combined with episode-level advantages from
outcome rewards for policy update, creating a self-reinforcing loop.
Theoretical findings guarantee that the learned step rewards are consistent
with trajectory preferences and act as potential-based shaping rewards,
providing bounded gradients to stabilize training. Empirically, we evaluate
OPRL on three distinct agent benmarks, including WebShop and VisualSokoban, as
well as open-ended social interactions with unverfiable rewards in SOTOPIA.
Crucially, OPRL shows superior performance over frontier <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s and strong RL
baselines across domains, achieving state-of-the-art results with higher
sample-efficiency and lower variance during training. Further analysis also
demonstrates the efficient exploration by OPRL using fewer actions,

<p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a variety of real-world tasks. However, existing VLMs typically process visual
information by serializing images, a method that diverges significantly from
the parallel nature of human vision. Moreover, their opaque internal mechanisms
hinder both deeper understanding and architectural innovation. Inspired by the
dual-stream hypothesis of human vision, which distinguishes the "what" and
"where" pathways, we deconstruct the visual processing in VLMs into object
recognition and spatial perception for separate study. For object recognition,
we convert images into text token maps and find that the model's perception of
image content unfolds as a two-stage process from shallow to deep layers,
beginning with attribute recognition and culminating in semantic
disambiguation. For spatial perception, we theoretically derive and empirically
verify the geometric structure underlying the positional representation in
VLMs. Based on these findings, we introduce an instruction-agnostic token

attention mechanisms to jointly predict bimanual poses and quality scores. This
conditioning strategy reduces the complexity of the 12-DoF search space while
ensuring coordinated bimanual manipulation. Comprehensive simulation

reached a high degree of naturalness. However, the precision control of TTS
inference is still challenging. Although instruction-based Text-to-Speech
(Instruct-TTS) models are proposed, these models still lack fine-grained
control due to the modality gap between single-level text instructions and
multilevel speech tokens. To address this limitation, we propose HD-PPT, a
framework that transforms speech synthesis into a structured, hierarchical
task. To enable fine-grained control, we introduce a novel speech codec to
extract distinct prompt-preference and content-preference tokens from the
complex speech tokens, supervised by automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
cross-lingual audio-text pre-training (CLAP) objectives. To bridge the modality
gap of these tokens, we propose a hierarchical <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decoding-F08080" /></a> strategy, where the <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>
generates tokens in a structured order: first semantic, then fine-grained
style, and finally complete acoustic representation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that this hierarchical paradigm significantly improves instruction
adherence and achieves state-of-the-art naturalness, validating our approach

significant accessibility challenges for blind and low-vision users. While
various tools attempt to evaluate PDF accessibility, there is no standardized

perform. Our work addresses this critical gap by introducing a novel benchmark
dataset of scholarly PDFs with expert-validated accessibility annotations
across seven criteria (alternative text quality, logical reading order,
semantic tagging, table structure, functional hyperlinks, color contrast, and
font readability), and a four-category evaluation framework with standardized

accessibility evaluation approaches. Using our evaluation framework, we explore
whether large language models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s) are capable of supporting automated

<p>Despite recent progress in large-scale sound event detection (SED) systems
capable of handling hundreds of sound classes, existing multi-class
classification frameworks remain fundamentally limited. They cannot process
free-text sound queries, which enable more flexible and user-friendly
interaction, and they lack zero-shot capabilities and offer poor few-shot

they primarily focus on source separation and are ill-suited for SED tasks that
require precise temporal localization and efficient detection across large and
diverse sound vocabularies. In this paper, we propose FlexSED, an
open-vocabulary sound event detection system. FlexSED builds on a pretrained
audio SSL model and the CLAP text encoder, introducing an encoder-<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>r

training from pretrained weights. To ensure robust supervision, it also employs

training, addressing challenges related to missing labels. As a result, FlexSED
achieves superior performance compared to vanilla SED models on

<p>Compared to traditional models, agentic AI represents a highly valuable

sources and API tools, which are traditionally not incorporated into classical

<p>Embedding vectors are widely used for representing unstructured data and
searching through it for semantically similar items. However, the large size of
these vectors, due to their high-dimensionality, creates problems for modern
vector search techniques: retrieving large vectors from memory/storage is

across diverse domains, their quadratic computational complexity with respect

latency-sensitive long-context applications. While recent linear-complexity

LAWCAT integrates
causal Conv1D layers to enhance local dependency modeling and employs
normalized gated linear attention to improve generalization across varying
context lengths. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that, distilling
Mistral-7B with only 1K-length sequences yields over 90\% passkey retrieval
accuracy up to 22K tokens, significantly extending its effective context

on S-NIAH 1\&amp;2\&amp;3 tasks (1K-8K context length) and BABILong benchmark

enabling dialogue systems to produce responses that are not only coherent but

(V2R), which models the progression of conversations following norm violations
through recognition and socially appropriate repair. To improve pragmatic
consistency in underrepresented languages, we implement an exemplar-based
iterative refinement early in the dialogue synthesis process. This design
introduces alignment with linguistic, emotional, and sociocultural expectations
before full dialogue generation begins. Using this framework, we construct a
dataset of 10,800 multi-turn dialogues annotated at the turn level for norm
adherence, speaker intent, and emotional response. Human and <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>-based
evaluations demonstrate that NormGenesis significantly outperforms existing

establishes a new benchmark for culturally adaptive dialogue modeling and

<p>Collisionless, turbulent plasmas surround the Earth, from the magnetosphere
to the intergalactic medium, and the fluctuations within them affect nearly
every field in the space sciences, from space weather forecasts to theories of
galaxy formation. Where turbulent motions become supersonic, their interactions
can lead to the formation of shocks, which are known to efficiently energize
ions to cosmic-ray energies. We present 2.5-dimensional, hybrid-kinetic
simulations of decaying, supersonic, non-relativistic turbulence in a
collisionless plasma using the code dHybridR. Turbulence within these
simulations is highly compressible; after accounting for this <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" /></a> by
taking the omni-directional power-spectrum of the density weighted velocity
field, we find turbulent spectra with power-law slopes of <script type="math/tex">\alpha \approx
-\frac{5}{3}</script> for low Mach numbers, in the inertial range, and <script type="math/tex">\alpha \approx
-2</script> for high Mach numbers. Ions embedded in the highly supersonic simulations
are accelerated to non-thermal energies at efficiencies similar to those seen
in shocks, despite being in a non-relativistic regime and lacking the large
scale structure of a shock. We observe that particles are accelerated into a
power-law spectrum, with a slope of <script type="math/tex">q \approx 2.5</script> in (non-relativistic)
energy. We compare these results to those obtained from the theory and

<p>Achieving high performance, energy efficiency, and cost-effectiveness while
maintaining architectural flexibility is a critical challenge in the
development and deployment of edge AI devices. Monolithic SoC designs struggle
with this complex balance mainly due to low manufacturing yields (below 16%) at
advanced 360 mm^2 process nodes. This paper presents a novel chiplet-based
RISC-V SoC architecture that addresses these limitations through modular AI
<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/acceleration-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/acceleration-F08080" /></a> and intelligent system level optimization. Our proposed design
integrates 4 different key innovations in a 30mm x 30mm silicon interposer:
adaptive cross-chiplet Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS); AI-aware
Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe) protocol extensions featuring
streaming flow control units and <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" /></a>-aware transfers; distributed
cryptographic security across heterogeneous chiplets; and intelligent
sensor-driven load migration. The proposed architecture integrates a 7nm RISC-V
CPU chiplet with dual 5nm AI accelerators (15 TOPS INT8 each), 16GB HBM3 memory
stacks, and dedicated power management controllers. Experimental results across
industry standard benchmarks like MobileNetV2, ResNet-50 and real-time video
processing demonstrate significant performance improvements. The AI-optimized
configuration achieves ~14.7% latency reduction, 17.3% throughput improvement,
and 16.2% power reduction compared to previous basic chiplet implementations.
These improvements collectively translate to a 40.1% efficiency gain
corresponding to ~3.5 mJ per MobileNetV2 inference (860 mW/244 images/s), while
maintaining sub-5ms real-time capability across all experimented workloads.
These performance upgrades demonstrate that modular chiplet designs can achieve
near-monolithic computational density while enabling cost efficiency,
scalability and upgradeability, crucial for next-generation edge AI device
applications.</p>

parameter offloading, utilizing a fast draft model to propose multiple draft
tokens, which are then verified by the target <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> in parallel with a single
forward pass. This method reduces the time-consuming data transfers in forward
passes that involve offloaded weight transfers. Existing methods often rely on
pretrained weights of the same family, but require additional training to align
with custom-trained models. Moreover, approaches that involve draft model
training usually yield only modest speedups. This limitation arises from
insufficient alignment with the target model, preventing higher token
acceptance lengths. To address these challenges and achieve greater speedups,
we propose SubSpec, a plug-and-play method to accelerate parameter offloading
that is lossless and training-free. SubSpec constructs a highly aligned draft
model by generating <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/low-bit-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/low-bit-F08080" /></a> <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantize-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/quantize-F08080" /></a>d substitute layers from offloaded target

SubSpec achieves a high average acceptance length, delivering 9.1x speedup for
Qwen2.5 7B on MT-Bench (8GB VRAM limit) and an average of 12.5x speedup for
Qwen2.5 32B on popular generation benchmarks (24GB VRAM limit).</p>

long sequences makes token-level credit assignment the key bottleneck. We study
the verifiable-reward setting, where the final answer is checkable and multiple
responses can be drawn per prompt. Reasoning tasks in math and medical QA align
with this setup, where only a few decision tokens significantly impact the
outcome. PPO offers token-level advantages with a learned value model, but it
is complex to train both the actor and critic models simultaneously, and it is
not easily generalizable, as the token-level values from the critic model can
make training prone to overfitting. GRPO is critic-free and supports verifiable
rewards, but spreads a single sequence-level return across tokens and ignores
branching. We introduce \textbf{Prefix-to-Tree (P2T)}, a simple procedure that
converts a group of responses into a prefix tree and computes
\emph{nonparametric} prefix values <script type="math/tex">V(s)</script> by aggregating descendant outcomes.
Built on P2T, we propose \textbf{TEMPO} (\emph{\textbf{T}ree-\textbf{E}stimated
\textbf{M}ean Prefix Value for \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization}), a
critic-free algorithm that augments the group-relative outcome signal of GRPO
with \emph{branch-gated} temporal-difference corrections derived from the tree.
At non-branch tokens, the temporal-difference (TD) term is zero, so TEMPO
reduces to GRPO; at branching tokens, it supplies precise token-level credit
without a learned value network or extra judges/teachers. On Qwen3-1.7B/4B,
TEMPO outperforms PPO and GRPO on in-distribution (MATH, MedQA) and
out-of-distribution (GSM-HARD, AMC23, MedMCQA, MMLU-Medical) benchmarks, and
reaches higher validation accuracy with roughly the same wall-clock time.</p>

auto-speculative manner. This approach is efficient and effective, and
eliminates the overheads of training and running an independent draft model. To
structure the candidate draft states, we propose a novel directed draft graph
which is uniquely designed to take advantage of the bidirectional, block-wise
nature of d<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> generation and can be verified in parallel by the d<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>.

<p>This paper introduces TempSamp-R1, a new reinforcement fine-tuning framework
designed to improve the effectiveness of adapting multimodal large language
models (M<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s) to video temporal grounding tasks. We reveal that existing
reinforcement learning methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), rely on on-policy sampling for policy updates. However, in tasks with
large temporal search spaces, this strategy becomes both inefficient and
limited in performance, as it often fails to identify temporally accurate
solutions. To address this limitation, TempSamp-R1 leverages ground-truth
annotations as off-policy supervision to provide temporally precise guidance,
effectively compensating for the <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparsity-F08080" /></a> and misalignment in on-policy
solutions. To further stabilize training and reduce variance in reward-based
updates, TempSamp-R1 provides a non-linear soft advantage computation method
that dynamically reshapes the reward feedback via an asymmetric transformation.
By employing a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training paradigm, TempSamp-R1
optimizes a single unified model to support both CoT and non-CoT inference
modes, enabling efficient handling of queries with varying reasoning
complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that TempSamp-R1 outperforms
GRPO-based baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance on
benchmark datasets: Charades-STA (R1@0.7: 52.9%, +2.7%), ActivityNet Captions
(R1@0.5: 56.0%, +5.3%), and QVHighlights (mAP: 30.0%, +3.0%). Moreover,
TempSamp-R1 shows robust few-shot generalization capabilities under limited

modalities with a more lightweight model, and pretrain a domain-specific
radiology encoder, demonstrating strong zero-shot retrieval performance. We
also release a richly annotated expert dataset with over 450 clinically

unclear whether principles of computer-mediated collaboration established in
HCI and CSCW persist, change, or fail when humans collaborate with <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> agents.
To support systematic investigations of these questions, we introduce an open
and configurable research platform for HCI researchers. The platform's modular
design allows seamless adaptation of classic CSCW experiments and manipulation
of theory-grounded interaction controls. We demonstrate the platform's
effectiveness and usability through two case studies: (1) re-implementing the

<p>Deep neural networks are powerful, yet their high complexity greatly limits
their potential to be deployed on billions of resource-constrained edge
devices. Pruning is a crucial network <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" /></a> technique, yet most existing
methods focus on classification models, with limited attention to detection.
Even among those addressing detection, there is a lack of utilization of
essential localization information. Also, many <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080" /></a> methods passively rely
on pre-trained models, in which useful and useless components are intertwined,
making it difficult to remove the latter without harming the former at the
neuron/filter level. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose a
proactive detection-discriminants-based network <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" /></a> approach for deep
visual detectors, which alternates between two steps: (1) maximizing and
compressing detection-related discriminants and aligning them with a subset of
neurons/filters immediately before the detection head, and (2) tracing the
detection-related discriminating power across the layers and discarding
features of lower importance. Object location information is exploited in both
steps. Extensive experiments, employing four advanced detection models and four
state-of-the-art competing methods on the KITTI and COCO datasets, highlight
the superiority of our approach. Remarkably, our compressed models can even
beat the original base models with a substantial reduction in complexity.</p>

<p>Auditory attention and selective phase-locking are central to human speech
understanding in complex acoustic scenes and cocktail party settings, yet these
capabilities in multilingual subjects remain poorly understood. While machine
understanding of natural speech has advanced in recent years, questions persist
about comprehension of <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" /></a>ped and mixed-channel speech. We propose a
systematic paradigm for studying humans and machines in speech
question-answering tasks in multilingual settings with clean and mixed-channel
speech. For human listeners, selective attention to a target speaker was
significantly better in their native language (L1) than in their second
language (L2). For machine listening, speech-based large language models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s)
match or exceed human performance in clean, single-speaker conditions but often
struggle to selectively attend in two-speaker settings. These results reveal a

<p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a standard paradigm for refining large
language models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s) beyond pre-training and instruction tuning. A prominent
line of work is RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which leverages
automatically verifiable outcomes (e.g., correctness or executability) to
generate reward signals. While efficient, this framework faces two key
limitations: First, its binary feedback is too <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> to capture the quality of
the reasoning process. Second, its coarse-grained rewards potentially lead to
vanishing gradients. Inspired by observations from human learning, we introduce
a RL technique that integrates verifiable outcomes with the model's own
confidence estimates. This joint design enriches the reward signal, providing
finer-grained feedback and implicitly supervising the reasoning process.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method enhances RL
performance across multiple datasets and reduces token consumption during
inference, while incurring negligible additional training cost. Moreover, it
can be used as a plug-in module to enhance other state-of-the-art RL methods.</p>

<p>Table question answering (TableQA) is a fundamental task in natural language
processing (NLP). The strong reasoning capabilities of large language models
(<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s) have brought significant advances in this field. However, as real-world
applications involve increasingly complex questions and larger tables,
substantial noisy data is introduced, which severely degrades reasoning
performance. To address this challenge, we focus on improving two core
capabilities: Relevance Filtering, which identifies and retains information
truly relevant to reasoning, and Table Pruning, which reduces table size while
pre<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00" /></a> essential content. Based on these principles, we propose EnoTab, a
dual denoising framework for complex questions and large-scale tables.
Specifically, we first perform Evidence-based Question Denoising by decomposing
the question into minimal semantic units and filtering out those irrelevant to
answer reasoning based on consistency and usability criteria. Then, we propose
Evidence Tree-guided Table Denoising, which constructs an explicit and
transparent table <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/pruning-F08080" /></a> path to remove irrelevant data step by step. At each

post-order node rollback mechanism to handle abnormal table states, ultimately
producing a highly reliable sub-table for final answer reasoning. Finally,
extensive experiments show that EnoTab achieves outstanding performance on
TableQA tasks with complex questions and large-scale tables, confirming its
effectiveness.</p>

<p>Despite growing research on bias in large language models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s), most work
has focused on gender and race, with little attention to religious identity.
This paper explores how religion is internally represented in <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s and how it
intersects with concepts of violence and geography. Using mechanistic
interpretability and Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) via the Neuronpedia API, we
analyze latent feature activations across five models. We measure <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" /></a>
between religion- and violence-related prompts and probe semantic patterns in
activation contexts. While all five religions show comparable internal
cohesion, Islam is more frequently linked to features associated with violent
language. In contrast, geographic associations largely reflect real-world
religious demographics, revealing how models embed both factual distributions
and cultural stereotypes. These findings highlight the value of structural
analysis in auditing not just outputs but also internal representations that
shape model behavior.</p>

scalability. We propose a training-free, inference-time token eviction policy
that bounds memory by discarding redundant tokens while keeping the most
informative ones. Our method uses significantly less memory with little to no
drop in accuracy: on 7-Scenes with long sequences it reduces peak memory from
18.63 GB to 9.39 GB while accuracy and completeness drop by only 0.003. Under
strict memory budgets, eviction enables denser frame sampling, which improves
reconstruction accuracy compared to the baseline. Experiments across video
depth estimation (Sintel, KITTI), 3D reconstruction (7-Scenes, NRGBD), and
camera pose estimation (Sintel, TUM-dynamics) show that our approach closely
matches StreamVGGT at a fraction of the memory and makes long-horizon streaming
inference more practical.</p>

the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between original and compressed sets, but
modern datasets are often large in both sample size and dimensionality. We
propose Bilateral Distribution Compression (BDC), a two-stage framework that
compresses along both axes while pre<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/serving-FF8C00" /></a> the underlying distribution, with
overall linear time and memory complexity in dataset size and dimension.
Central to BDC is the Decoded MMD (DMMD), which quantifies the discrepancy
between the original data and a compressed set <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>d from a low-dimensional
latent space. BDC proceeds by (i) learning a low-dimensional projection using
the Reconstruction MMD (RMMD), and (ii) optimising a latent compressed set with
the Encoded MMD (EMMD). We show that this procedure minimises the DMMD,
guaranteeing that the compressed set faithfully represents the original
distribution. Experiments show that across a variety of scenarios BDC can

inference system is an urgent problem to be solved for service providers. Since
the inference system is divided into two stage with different characteristics:
Prefill and Decode, the two stage will interfere with each other during the
inference process. Toward this end, a P-D <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/disaggregate-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/disaggregate-F08080" /></a>d inference framework is
proposed by some researchers. Current research is done on homogeneous GPUs, and
lacks deployment solutions based on business scenarios. Compared with
homogeneous GPUs, using heterogeneous GPUs to construct inference systems can
better improve resource utilization and reduce costs. Even if GPUs from
different vendors are used to build inference systems, on the basis of reducing
costs, the resource utilization rate can be improved and the dependence on a
single vendor can be reduced. Therefore, a P-D disaggreagetd inference system
based on heterogeneous GPUs is designed, and the heterogeneous compatible
transmission module in the system is designed to address heterogeneous GPU data
compatibility issues. Then, a joint optimization algorithm of parallel strategy
and instance number allocation is proposed to obtain the deployment solutions.
Finally, the experimental results show that the P-D <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/disaggregate-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/disaggregate-F08080" /></a>d inference

reduce biases from superficial <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>r tendencies. Second, progressive,
energy-based hybrid clustering stabilizes semantic grouping. Experiments on

robust and generalizable hallucination detection. These results demonstrate
that combining input diversification with multi-signal clustering substantially
enhances semantic-level uncertainty estimation.</p>

to simulate HEVC <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" /></a>. This approach not only in creases watermarking
capacity but also enhances robustness. DINVMark employs an Invertible Neural
Network (INN), where the encoder and <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>r share the same network structure
for both watermark embedding and extraction. This shared architecture ensures
close coupling between the encoder and <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>r, thereby improving the accuracy
of the watermark extraction process. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed scheme significantly enhances watermark robustness, preserves video
quality, and substantially increases watermark embedding capacity.</p>

This paper
addresses this long-standing question through the first systematic analysis of
6.6K features across all layers, extracted via <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/sparse-F08080" /></a> autoencoders, and by
introducing the residual replacement model, which replaces ViT computations
with interpretable features in the residual stream. Our analysis reveals not
only a feature evolution from low-level patterns to high-level semantics, but
also how ViTs encode curves and spatial positions through specialized feature
types. The residual replacement model scalably produces a faithful yet
parsimonious circuit for human-scale interpretability by significantly
simplifying the original computations. As a result, this framework enables
intuitive understanding of ViT mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate the utility
of our framework in debiasing spurious correlations.</p>

<p>With the rising global burden of chronic diseases and the multimodal and
heterogeneous clinical data (medical imaging, free-text recordings, wearable
sensor streams, etc.), there is an urgent need for a unified multimodal AI
framework that can proactively predict individual health risks. We propose
VL-RiskFormer, a hierarchical stacked visual-language multimodal Transformer
with a large language model (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>) inference head embedded in its top layer. The
system builds on the dual-stream architecture of existing visual-linguistic
models (e.g., PaLM-E, LLaVA) with four key innovations: (i) pre-training with
cross-modal comparison and fine-grained alignment of radiological images,
fundus maps, and wearable device photos with corresponding clinical narratives
using momentum update encoders and debiased InfoNCE losses; (ii) a time fusion
block that integrates irregular visit sequences into the causal Transformer
<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>r through adaptive time interval position coding; (iii) a disease
ontology map adapter that injects ICD-10 codes into visual and textual channels
in layers and infers comorbid patterns with the help of a graph attention
mechanism. On the MIMIC-IV longitudinal cohort, VL-RiskFormer achieved an
average AUROC of 0.90 with an expected calibration error of 2.7 percent.</p>

research and code generation. However, their effectiveness depends on frequent
interactions with knowledge sources across remote clouds or regions. Such
interactions can create non-trivial latency and cost bottlenecks. Existing
caching solutions focus on exact-match queries, limiting their effectiveness
for semantic knowledge reuse.
  To address this challenge, we introduce Asteria, a novel cross-region
knowledge caching architecture for <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> agents. At its core are two
abstractions: Semantic Element (SE) and Semantic Retrieval Index (Sine). A
semantic element captures the semantic embedding representation of an <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> query
together with performance-aware metadata such as latency, cost, and staticity.
Sine then provides two-stage retrieval: a vector similar index with semantic
embedding for fast candidate selection and a lightweight <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>-powered semantic

cost-efficient eviction policy, and proactive prefetching. To reduce overhead,
Asteria co-locates the small <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> judger with the main <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a> using adaptive

<p>Transonic buffet presents time-dependent aerodynamic characteristics
associated with shock, turbulent boundary layer, and their interactions.
Despite strong nonlinearities and a large degree of freedom, there exists a
dominant dynamic pattern of a buffet cycle, suggesting the low dimensionality
of transonic buffet phenomena. This study seeks a low-dimensional
representation of transonic airfoil buffet at a high Reynolds number with
machine learning. Wall-modeled large-eddy simulations of flow over the OAT15A
supercritical airfoil at two Mach numbers, <script type="math/tex">M_\infty = 0.715</script> and 0.730,
respectively producing non-buffet and buffet conditions, at a chord-based
Reynolds number of <script type="math/tex">Re = 3\times 10^6</script> are performed to generate the present
datasets. We find that the low-dimensional nature of transonic airfoil buffet
can be extracted as a sole three-dimensional latent representation through
lift-augmented autoencoder <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/compression-FF8C00" /></a>. The current low-order representation
not only describes the shock movement but also captures the moment when the
separation occurs near the trailing edge in a low-order manner. We further show
that it is possible to perform sensor-based reconstruction through the present
low-dimensional expression while identifying the sensitivity with respect to
aerodynamic responses. The present model trained at <script type="math/tex">Re = 3\times 10^6</script> is
lastly evaluated at the level of a real aircraft operation of <script type="math/tex">Re = 3\times

<p>Cognitive distortions have been closely linked to mental health disorders,
yet their automatic detection remained challenging due to contextual ambiguity,
co-occurrence, and semantic <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" /></a>. We proposed a novel framework that
combines Large Language Models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s) with Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)
architecture to enhance interpretability and expression-level reasoning. Each
utterance was decomposed into Emotion, Logic, and Behavior (ELB) components,
which were processed by <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s to infer multiple distortion instances, each with
a predicted type, expression, and model-assigned salience score. These
instances were integrated via a Multi-View Gated Attention mechanism for final
classification. Experiments on Korean (KoACD) and English (Therapist QA)
datasets demonstrate that incorporating ELB and <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>-inferred salience scores
improves classification performance, especially for distortions with high
interpretive ambiguity. Our results suggested a psychologically grounded and
generalizable approach for fine-grained reasoning in mental health NLP.</p>

<p>We propose DeepASA, a one-for-all model for auditory scene analysis that
performs multi-input multi-output (MIMO) source separation, dereverberation,
sound event detection (SED), audio classification, and direction-of-arrival
estimation (DoAE) within a unified framework. DeepASA is designed for complex
auditory scenes where multiple, often similar, sound sources <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/overlap-F08080" /></a> in time
and move dynamically in space. To achieve robust and consistent inference
across tasks, we introduce an object-oriented processing (OOP) strategy. This
approach encapsulates diverse auditory features into object-centric
representations and refines them through a chain-of-inference (CoI) mechanism.
The pipeline comprises a dynamic temporal kernel-based feature extractor, a
<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/transformer-FF8C00" /></a>-based aggregator, and an object separator that yields per-object
features. These features feed into multiple task-specific <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/decode-F08080" /></a>rs. Our
object-centric representations naturally resolve the parameter association
ambiguity inherent in traditional track-wise processing. However, early-stage
object separation can lead to failure in downstream ASA tasks. To address this,
we implement temporal coherence matching (TCM) within the chain-of-inference,
enabling multi-task fusion and iterative refinement of object features using
estimated auditory parameters. We evaluate DeepASA on representative spatial
audio benchmark datasets, including ASA2, MC-FUSS, and STARSS23. Experimental
results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across all
evaluated tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in both source separation and
auditory parameter estimation under diverse spatial auditory scenes.</p>

utilizing inference-time sequence-level scaling methods (e.g.,
Chain-of-Thought). We introduce hyper-parallel scaling, a complementary
framework that improves prediction quality at the token level. Hyper-parallel
scaling computes and aggregates multiple output proposals for a single token
from the model. We implement this concept in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models,
which we refer to as Roster of Experts (RoE). RoE is a training-free inference
algorithm that turns a single MoE into a dynamic ensemble of MoEs. RoE injects
controlled stochasticity into the expert routing mechanism, enabling it to
sample multiple diverse experts for each token and aggregate their outputs for
a more accurate final prediction.To overcome the computational cost, we
introduce an efficient batching strategy and a specialized <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/KV-F08080" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/KV-F08080" /></a>-caching mechanism
that minimizes compute and memory overhead. For example, RoE enables a 7B MoE
model to match the performance of a 10.5B MoE model while using 30% less
compute for inference. These gains are achieved without any fine-tuning of
model parameters.</p>

<p>Modern signal processing (SP) pipelines, whether model-based or data-driven,
often constrained by complex and fragmented workflow, rely heavily on expert
knowledge and manual engineering, and struggle with adaptability and
generalization under limited data. In contrast, Large Language Models (<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>s)
offer strong reasoning capabilities, broad general-purpose knowledge,
in-context learning, and cross-modal transfer abilities, positioning them as
powerful tools for automating and generalizing SP workflows. Motivated by these
potentials, we introduce Signal<a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>, the first general-purpose <a class="glightbox" href="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="key" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LLM-FF8C00" /></a>-based agent

principled, modular architecture. It decomposes high-level SP goals into
structured subtasks via in-context learning and domain-specific retrieval,
followed by hierarchical planning through adaptive retrieval-augmented

multi-robot systems (DC-MRS). Challenges in collaboration in DC-MRS arise from:

the consistency of maximal attention. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that
MACS achieves a favorable trade-off between interpretability quality and
computational efficiency, showing faithfulness comparable to complex techniques
with a 22\% decrease in VRAM usage and 30\% reduction in latency.</p>
